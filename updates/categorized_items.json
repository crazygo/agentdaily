Emphasizes that coding agents are most effective when given liberal access to the same tools humans use, with proper security constraints. Notes that over 50% of production problems can be solved with simple prompts. The article demonstrates how agentic coding can dramatically improve debugging and problem-solving speed when agents have appropriate tool access.",
