[system]
You are an AI research analyst specialized in AI developer tools:
code agents, AI IDEs, AI coding CLIs, and related devtools.

Your **global goal**:
- Find genuinely new products that have been publicly launched in the **last 14 days**
- AND that clearly target **programming / code / AI dev workflows**
- THEN summarize only the valid ones in a **clean YAML list**.

You MUST treat the questions in the `user:` section as your **research QUESTION list**.
Each QUESTION is a different “angle” on the same market (e.g., full AI IDE, CLI, workflow-focused, etc.).

To organize your reasoning, use this formula:

> Answer = Sort( Filter( Union(Sources) ) )

You must conceptually follow these four stages:

1. **Sources → candidate list (per QUESTION)**
   - For each QUESTION from the `user:` section:
     - Search the web and relevant directories / launch pages.
     - Collect as many **candidate products** as are reasonably relevant.
   - For each candidate, internally track at least:
     - `name` (product name)
     - `url` (official homepage or primary landing page)
     - `description` (1–3 sentences in English summarizing what it does)
     - `sources` (which QUESTION(s) and which site(s) you saw it on)
   - At this stage you are allowed to over-collect; do **not** filter by date yet unless it is trivial.

2. **Union(candidates) → unified candidate set**
   - Merge candidates across all QUESTIONS into a single conceptual set:
     - Deduplicate products that clearly refer to the same thing
       (same URL, or obviously the same product name + branding).
   - After this step you have a unified **candidate pool**:
     - It may still contain old products, or products outside our domain.

3. **Filter(Union) → filtered candidate list**
   - For each product in the unified pool:
     - Investigate its **launch / first public release date** from credible public info
       (official site, launch post, Product Hunt / HN launch, blog, press, etc.).
     - Decide if it satisfies **both**:
       1) Launch date is within the last **14 days** (relative to “today”).
       2) Product is clearly related to **AI coding / code agents / IDE / dev workflows**.
   - If you cannot reasonably verify that the launch is within 14 days,
     **treat it as NOT valid** and exclude it.
   - Internally keep, for each surviving product:
     - `release_date` in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (best reasonable guess)
     - short one-line justification (do not put the justification in final YAML).

4. **Sort(filtered candidates) → final ordered list**
   - Only work with products that passed the filter.
   - Rank them by a simple mental score combining:
     - **recency** (more recent launch date is better),
     - **attention** (strong launch signal: PH upvotes, HN discussion, X/Reddit buzz),
     - **relevance** (how closely it fits “AI coding agent / IDE / devtool”).
   - You do not need to show the numeric score, just use it to order the list.


### Claude Code / todo-style planning requirements

When running inside Claude Code with access to a `todowrite` (or similar TODO-list) tool,
you MUST first externalize this plan as an explicit TODO list **before** doing any research.

Follow these rules:

0. Start with a planning item: add `Consider how to update todos based on products` as the very first TODO.

1. Based on the QUESTION list in the `user:` section, use the `todowrite` tool to create **one TODO item per QUESTION**.  
   - Each item should correspond to “Sources(QUESTION_i)” — i.e., collecting candidates for that QUESTION.

2. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Union** stage:  
   - e.g. “Union(all source results)” to merge candidates from all QUESTION-based source tasks.

3. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Filter** stage:  
   - e.g. “Filter(union) by launch date ≤ 14 days and AI coding relevance”.

4. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Sort** stage and final write-out:  
   - e.g. “Sort(filtered) and write result to result.yaml (or final-products.yaml)”.

A minimal example of the TODO list structure you are expected to build is (showing the alternating “record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” steps):

TODO List
- [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
...
- [ ] Union(sources from 1 to 3)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Write result to new-product.json
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

You may have more than 3 QUESTION-based source items (e.g. 7), but the pattern MUST be the same:
first all `Sources(QUESTION i)` items, then one `Union(...)`, one or more `Filter(...)` based on the number of unique products, one `Sort(...)`,
and finally one “write result” item.

You should use this TODO list as the execution plan and mark items as completed as you progress.

After all `Sources(QUESTION i)` tasks are done, you MUST rewrite the TODO list:
- Replace the generic filter items with one `Filter(<product name>)` per discovered product (the count of Filter items must equal the number of products).
- Keep `Sort(filtered)` and the final write step after those filter items.

Example refreshed TODO after finding 3 products:
TODO List
- [ ] Filter(Product Alpha)
- [ ] Filter(Product Beta)
- [ ] Filter(Product Gamma)
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Write result to result.yaml

**Progress logging pattern (few-shot)**
- After EVERY action item, add an explicit “Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” item (and mark it done once you rewrite and overwrite the file).
- This enforces a rhythm of: do a step → record progress → rewrite TODO → update `new-product.json` → next step.
- Sample pattern the model should mirror:
  - [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Union(all source results)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sort(filtered)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Write result to new-product.json
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

**Final output format (what you actually return):**

- Return a **JSON array** of products, sorted from most to least interesting.
- Each entry MUST have the following fields:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "name": "<product name>",
      "url": "<official homepage>",
      "description": "1–3 sentence summary of what this product does, focused on the developer / AI-coding use case.",
      "release_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "category": "<short label, e.g. \"AI IDE\", \"AI coding CLI\", \"code agent\", \"workflow agent\">",
      "sources": ["Product Hunt", "Show HN", "Reddit", "X"],
      "community_quotes": [
        "<short quote from community describing what people like or notice>",
        "<up to 5 quotes total, can be paraphrased but must reflect real feedback>"
      ]
    }
  ]
```

* Only include products that:

  * You have **good evidence** were launched in the last 14 days, and
  * Clearly belong to the **AI coding / developer tools** space.

* If you cannot find any products that satisfy the 14-day constraint,
  return an empty JSON array: `[]`.

Be concise, factual, and avoid marketing fluff. Do **not** include your reasoning text
in the final answer—only the JSON.

**File output + incremental updates requirement**
- Maintain a file named `new-product` in the current working directory.
- After every step (including each “Record progress, rewrite todo”), write the current JSON array to `new-product` (overwrite). Early steps may be partial/rough; later steps should be refined.
- The JSON must always be valid and reflect the best current view (start with `[]` if nothing yet).
- After the final step, ensure `new-product` holds the final sorted array.

## Working Directory Context

Your current working directory is: `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2025-12-19`

All file operations should be relative to this directory.

---

Below is your QUESTION list. For each QUESTION, treat it as a separate “research lens”
to discover newly launched AI coding products (global constraint: last 14 days).

1. QUESTION 1
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that position themselves as a “full AI IDE” (similar to Windsurf or Cursor), not just a small autocomplete plugin.

2. QUESTION 2
   List newly launched AI coding CLIs or terminal-based agents from the last 14 days that behave like Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, or Claude Code CLI (repo-aware, can run commands, can manage tasks).

3. QUESTION 5
   List newly launched AI tools from the last 14 days that focus on one specific developer workflow (for example debugging, refactoring, test generation, or migration) instead of being a general-purpose coding assistant.

4. QUESTION 7
   List newly launched AI code agents from the last 14 days that advertise “project-long memory” or “workspace memory” across multiple sessions (not just single-chat context).

5. QUESTION 11
   List newly launched open-source AI coding agents from the last 14 days that can be self-hosted or run locally by developers.

6. QUESTION 14
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that integrate directly into existing IDEs (such as VS Code, JetBrains, or Neovim) rather than being a standalone IDE.

7. QUESTION 16
   List newly launched AI agents from the last 14 days that help developers run or orchestrate complex workflows across tools (for example CI/CD, deployment, observability, or incident response), rather than only editing code.

[assistant message #2]

Here are the key findings:\n\n## Major AI IDE Announcements in 2025\n\n### **Kiro IDE (Amazon Web Services)**\n- **Announced**: July 2025 at AWS Summit NYC\n- **Status**: Public preview, generally available by November 2025\n- **Key Features**: Agentic AI development, spec-driven development, autonomous agent capabilities\n- **Recent Updates**: New features added in December 2025 (Powers, Auto Summarization, Slash Commands)\n\n### **Google Antigravity**\n- **Announced**: November 18, 2025 (alongside Gemini 3 AI model)\n- **Type**: New agentic development platform described as an \"AI-first IDE\"\n- **Focus**: Task-oriented development platform\n\n### **Theia IDE**\n- **Positioning**: AI-native, modern, open-source development environment\n- **Features**: Runs on desktop and cloud, not a VS Code fork\n- **AI Integration**: Transparent AI capabilities\n\n## 2025 AI Coding Tool Landscape\n\nThe search results indicate that 2025 was described as \"the start of the Agentic Era\" for AI coding tools, with the industry moving beyond simple IDE chatbots to more sophisticated agentic CLIs and full IDE solutions.\n\n**Key trends in 2025:**\n- Movement from code completion to full agentic development\n- Spec-driven development approaches\n- Integration of AI throughout the entire development lifecycle\n- Focus on autonomous agents that can work from prototype to production\n\nWhile no brand new \"full IDE\" was specifically launched in December 2025, the AI development tools space saw significant evolution throughout the year, with major players like Amazon (Kiro) and Google (Antigravity) introducing comprehensive AI-powered development environments.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

Here's what I found:\n\n## Closest Match: Nao (AI Data IDE)\n\nThe most relevant find is **Nao**, which launched in **November 2025** (just before December) and achieved #1 on Product Hunt:\n\n- **Product**: [Nao - AI data IDE](https://www.producthunt.com/products/nao-2)\n- **Launch Date**: November 2025\n- **Description**: AI-powered data IDE for analysts, engineers, and scientists to write SQL, Python, or dbt workflows\n- **Key Features**: \n  - Preview changes\n  - Catch issues early\n  - Deploy with confidence\n  - Direct connection to data warehouses\n  - Claims to provide \"10x faster data work\"\n\nHowever, Nao is specifically focused on **data work** rather than general-purpose coding.\n\n## Other Recent AI IDE/Coding Tools from 2025:\n\n1. **Orchids** - \"The Vibe Coding IDE\" for building full-stack apps with AI integration\n2. **Kilo Code** - Open-source AI coding assistant for JetBrains IDEs\n3. **Augment Code** - Coding assistant with full codebase awareness (launched February 2025)\n4. **CodeAI** - Personal AI coding assistant with full-stack development capabilities\n\n## Note on Search Results:\n\nIt appears that my searches may be limited by the current date (August 2025), so December 2025 launches wouldn't be available yet in the search results. The most recent major AI IDE launches I found were from earlier in 2025.\n\nIf you're looking for information about a specific AI IDE that launched in December 2025, you might want to check:\n- Product Hunt directly for December 2025 launches\n- The specific product's website or announcement\n- Tech news sites for December 2025 coverage\n\nWould you like me to search for any specific AI IDE name or feature you're looking for?\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

Here's what I found:\n\n## Closest Match: Nao (AI Data IDE)\n\nThe most relevant find is **Nao**, which launched in **November 2025** (just before December) and achieved #1 on Product Hunt:\n\n- **Product**: [Nao - AI data IDE](https://www.producthunt.com/products/nao-2)\n- **Launch Date**: November 2025\n- **Description**: AI-powered data IDE for analysts, engineers, and scientists to write SQL, Python, or dbt workflows\n- **Key Features**: \n  - Preview changes\n  - Catch issues early\n  - Deploy with confidence\n  - Direct connection to data warehouses\n  - Claims to provide \"10x faster data work\"\n\nHowever, Nao is specifically focused on **data work** rather than general-purpose coding.\n\n## Other Recent AI IDE/Coding Tools from 2025:\n\n1. **Orchids** - \"The Vibe Coding IDE\" for building full-stack apps with AI integration\n2. **Kilo Code** - Open-source AI coding assistant for JetBrains IDEs\n3. **Augment Code** - Coding assistant with full codebase awareness (launched February 2025)\n4. **CodeAI** - Personal AI coding assistant with full-stack development capabilities\n\n## Note on Search Results:\n\nIt appears that my searches may be limited by the current date (August 2025), so December 2025 launches wouldn't be available yet in the search results. The most recent major AI IDE launches I found were from earlier in 2025.\n\nIf you're looking for information about a specific AI IDE that launched in December 2025, you might want to check:\n- Product Hunt directly for December 2025 launches\n- The specific product's website or announcement\n- Tech news sites for December 2025 coverage\n\nWould you like me to search for any specific AI IDE name or feature you're looking for?"

Here's what I found:\n\n### Key Details:\n- **Launch Date**: November 18, 2025\n- **Platform**: Agentic AI development platform\n- **Core Features**: \n  - AI agents that can autonomously plan, execute, and verify complex coding tasks\n  - Based on VS Code fork with enhanced AI capabilities\n  - Natural language code commands\n  - Tab autocompletion and configurable AI workflows\n\n### Platform Coverage:\n\n**Hacker News Discussions:**\n- [Main discussion thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45967814) - Nov 19, 2025\n- [Data security concerns thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46048996) - Nov 25, 2025\n- [Community experience thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46123682) - Dec 2, 2025\n\n**Product Hunt:**\n- [Product Hunt page](https://www.producthunt.com/products/google-antigravity) - Shows recent activity (9 hours ago)\n\n**Additional \"Show HN\" mentions:**\n- Various related projects and discussions referencing the platform\n\n### Community Reception:\nThe Hacker News discussions show mixed reception:\n- Users noted it's a VS Code fork with some UI improvements\n- Security concerns were raised about potential data exfiltration\n- Some found it to have meaningful improvements over competitors like Cursor\n\nWhile Google Antigravity wasn't launched specifically in December 2025 (it was mid-November), it appears to be the most significant AI IDE launch from that time period that gained traction on both Hacker News and Product Hunt. The platform continued to see discussions and updates into December 2025.\n\nWould you like me to search for any other AI IDEs or development tools that might have launched in December 2025 specifically?\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

      "Based on my search results, I found one major AI IDE launch from November 2025 that was covered on both Product Hunt and Hacker News, though it was launched slightly before December 2025.\n\n## Google Antigravity\n\n**Google Antigravity** is a significant AI IDE that was launched in **November 2025**, announced alongside the release of Gemini 3. Here's what I found:\n\n### Key Details:\n- **Launch Date**: November 18, 2025\n- **Platform**: Agentic AI development platform\n- **Core Features**: \n  - AI agents that can autonomously plan, execute, and verify complex coding tasks\n  - Based on VS Code fork with enhanced AI capabilities\n  - Natural language code commands\n  - Tab autocompletion and configurable AI workflows\n\n### Platform Coverage:\n\n**Hacker News Discussions:**\n- [Main discussion thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45967814) - Nov 19, 2025\n- [Data security concerns thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46048996) - Nov 25, 2025\n- [Community experience thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46123682) - Dec 2, 2025\n\n**Product Hunt:**\n- [Product Hunt page](https://www.producthunt.com/products/google-antigravity) - Shows recent activity (9 hours ago)\n\n**Additional \"Show HN\" mentions:**\n- Various related projects and discussions referencing the platform\n\n### Community Reception:\nThe Hacker News discussions show mixed reception:\n- Users noted it's a VS Code fork with some UI improvements\n- Security concerns were raised about potential data exfiltration\n- Some found it to have meaningful improvements over competitors like Cursor\n\nWhile Google Antigravity wasn't launched specifically in December 2025 (it was mid-November), it appears to be the most significant AI IDE launch from that time period that gained traction on both Hacker News and Product Hunt. The platform continued to see discussions and updates into December 2025.\n\nWould you like me to search for any other AI IDEs or development tools that might have launched in December 2025 specifically?"

Here are the key findings:\n\n## Major AI CLI/Terminal Agents Found:\n\n**1. Mistral Vibe CLI**\n- A repo-aware coding agent from Mistral AI\n- Terminal-first, understands entire projects (not just single files)\n- Uses Devstral 2 (123B) model\n- Recent significant updates mentioned in December 2025\n\n**2. Claude Code**\n- Anthropic's terminal-native AI coding agent\n- Built around safety and reliability\n- Focuses on developers who prefer terminal workflows\n- Compared favorably against other tools\n\n**3. OpenAI Codex CLI**\n- Open-source local coding agent\n- Translates natural language commands into executable code\n- Strong at code-research, planning, and bug-finding\n- Recently compared with Claude Code\n\n**4. Other Notable Tools:**\n- **Aider** - mentioned in terminal AI coding revolution discussions\n- **OpenCode** - open-source AI coding agent for terminal/IDE/desktop\n- **CLI Manager** - dashboard to organize multiple AI CLI agents\n\n## Key Trends:\n- 2025 is described as \"The Year of the Agents\"\n- Focus on repo-aware context and project understanding\n- Terminal-native workflows becoming more sophisticated\n- Integration with development tools and APIs\n\n**Note:** While I found information about these tools and their recent developments, I couldn't locate a specific Product Hunt launch from December 2025 matching your exact query. The search results show ongoing development and launches in this space throughout 2025, with several tools gaining significant traction.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

      "Based on my web search, I found several relevant results about AI CLI and terminal agents, though I couldn't find a specific tool that was launched on Product Hunt in December 2025. Here are the key findings:\n\n## Major AI CLI/Terminal Agents Found:\n\n**1. Mistral Vibe CLI**\n- A repo-aware coding agent from Mistral AI\n- Terminal-first, understands entire projects (not just single files)\n- Uses Devstral 2 (123B) model\n- Recent significant updates mentioned in December 2025\n\n**2. Claude Code**\n- Anthropic's terminal-native AI coding agent\n- Built around safety and reliability\n- Focuses on developers who prefer terminal workflows\n- Compared favorably against other tools\n\n**3. OpenAI Codex CLI**\n- Open-source local coding agent\n- Translates natural language commands into executable code\n- Strong at code-research, planning, and bug-finding\n- Recently compared with Claude Code\n\n**4. Other Notable Tools:**\n- **Aider** - mentioned in terminal AI coding revolution discussions\n- **OpenCode** - open-source AI coding agent for terminal/IDE/desktop\n- **CLI Manager** - dashboard to organize multiple AI CLI agents\n\n## Key Trends:\n- 2025 is described as \"The Year of the Agents\"\n- Focus on repo-aware context and project understanding\n- Terminal-native workflows becoming more sophisticated\n- Integration with development tools and APIs\n\n**Note:** While I found information about these tools and their recent developments, I couldn't locate a specific Product Hunt launch from December 2025 matching your exact query. The search results show ongoing development and launches in this space throughout 2025, with several tools gaining significant traction."

You may want to search for tools that were launched in December 2024 or are planning to launch in the future.\n\nWould you like me to search for AI coding tools that were launched in December 2024, or are you perhaps looking for announcements about tools planned for future release in December 2025?\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

      "Based on my search results, I found some relevant information about AI coding tools and extensions, but I need to clarify something important about your search timeframe.\n\n## Key Finding: \"AI Coding\" Plugin\n\nI found a notable AI tool that was recently updated:\n\n**AI Coding Plugin for JetBrains IDEs**\n- **Found on**: JetBrains Marketplace\n- **Latest update**: December 8, 2025\n- **Description**: An \"all-in-one AI copilot designed to seamlessly integrate LLM power into your IDE\" that supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP)\n- **Features**: Helps developers use AI providers (OpenAI/Claude/Baidu/Google) more conveniently\n\nHowever, I should note that my search results don't show evidence of a single, major new AI tool that was simultaneously launched across VS Code, JetBrains, AND Neovim specifically in December 2025.\n\n## Other AI Tools Mentioned\n\nThe search results also mention several established AI coding tools:\n\n- **JetBrains AI Assistant** - Extended to VS Code in May 2025\n- **Continue** - Available for both VS Code and JetBrains\n- **Cursor** - An AI-first VS Code fork with MCP support\n- **Various Neovim plugins** with AI capabilities and MCP integration\n\n## Important Note About Timeline\n\nSince we're currently in August 2025, there wouldn't be any tools that were actually \"launched in December 2025\" yet. You may want to search for tools that were launched in December 2024 or are planning to launch in the future.\n\nWould you like me to search for AI coding tools that were launched in December 2024, or are you perhaps looking for announcements about tools planned for future release in December 2025?"

[assistant message #63]
Now I'll merge all the candidates from my searches across all questions to create a unified candidate pool. Let me analyze all the products I discovered:

**From my research, here are the candidate products found:**

1. **Google Antigravity** - AI-first IDE launched November 2025
2. **Nao** - AI data IDE launched November 2025  
3. **Kiro** - Amazon's agentic IDE with autonomous agents
4. **Gemini CLI** - Open-source AI coding agent (June 2025)
5. **Mistral Vibe CLI** - Terminal-native AI coding agent
6. **Chronos-1** - Debugging-first language model (July 2025)
7. **Atla AI** - AI agent error detection tool
8. **Kilo Code** - Open-source AI coding agent that raised $8M in December 2025
9. **AI Coding Plugin** - JetBrains plugin updated December 2025
10. **Cognite** - AI agent orchestration updates (December 2025)
11. **Jakarta Agentic AI Project** - New initiative (December 2025)

However, I need to note an important issue: the current date is August 2025, but the questions ask about products launched in "December 2025" which is in the future. This creates a logical inconsistency. Let me proceed with the union process and then address this in the filtering stage.

[assistant message #70]
Now I need to filter the candidates by the launch date constraint (last 14 days) and AI coding relevance. However, I need to address a critical issue: the current date according to the system is December 19, 2025, which means I should be looking for products launched between December 5-19, 2025.

But my searches didn't reveal any products that were specifically launched in this exact 14-day window. Most of the products I found were launched earlier in 2025 or were updates rather than new launches.

Let me proceed with the filtering based on the constraint that products must have been launched within the last 14 days (December 5-19, 2025):

[assistant message #73]
Based on my comprehensive research across all the questions, I did not find any AI coding/developer tools that were launched within the last 14 days (December 5-19, 2025) that meet the specified criteria. While I discovered many interesting AI coding tools and platforms throughout 2025, none were specifically launched in this 14-day window.

The products I found were either:
1. Launched earlier in 2025 (like Google Antigravity in November, or Kilo Code's funding round in December but not a product launch)
2. Existing products with updates or announcements
3. Not specifically targeting AI coding/developer workflows

Therefore, the filtered and sorted result is an empty array, which is the correct outcome given the strict time constraint of "launched in the last 14 days."

Based on my comprehensive research across 7 different research lenses covering AI IDEs, coding CLIs, workflow-specific tools, memory-capable agents, open-source solutions, IDE extensions, and workflow orchestration tools, I found no AI coding/developer tools that were launched within the last 14 days (December 5-19, 2025).

While I discovered many notable AI development tools launched throughout 2025 - including Google Antigravity, Kiro IDE, Nao, and various CLI agents - none met the specific requirement of being launched within this 14-day window. The most recent developments were primarily updates, funding rounds, or feature announcements rather than new product launches.

This result accurately reflects the current state of the market for this specific time period.
