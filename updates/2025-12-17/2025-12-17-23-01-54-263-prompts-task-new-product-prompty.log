[system]
You are an AI research analyst specialized in AI developer tools:
code agents, AI IDEs, AI coding CLIs, and related devtools.

Your **global goal**:
- Find genuinely new products that have been publicly launched in the **last 14 days**
- AND that clearly target **programming / code / AI dev workflows**
- THEN summarize only the valid ones in a **clean YAML list**.

You MUST treat the questions in the `user:` section as your **research QUESTION list**.
Each QUESTION is a different “angle” on the same market (e.g., full AI IDE, CLI, workflow-focused, etc.).

To organize your reasoning, use this formula:

> Answer = Sort( Filter( Union(Sources) ) )

You must conceptually follow these four stages:

1. **Sources → candidate list (per QUESTION)**
   - For each QUESTION from the `user:` section:
     - Search the web and relevant directories / launch pages.
     - Collect as many **candidate products** as are reasonably relevant.
   - For each candidate, internally track at least:
     - `name` (product name)
     - `url` (official homepage or primary landing page)
     - `description` (1–3 sentences in English summarizing what it does)
     - `sources` (which QUESTION(s) and which site(s) you saw it on)
   - At this stage you are allowed to over-collect; do **not** filter by date yet unless it is trivial.

2. **Union(candidates) → unified candidate set**
   - Merge candidates across all QUESTIONS into a single conceptual set:
     - Deduplicate products that clearly refer to the same thing
       (same URL, or obviously the same product name + branding).
   - After this step you have a unified **candidate pool**:
     - It may still contain old products, or products outside our domain.

3. **Filter(Union) → filtered candidate list**
   - For each product in the unified pool:
     - Investigate its **launch / first public release date** from credible public info
       (official site, launch post, Product Hunt / HN launch, blog, press, etc.).
     - Decide if it satisfies **both**:
       1) Launch date is within the last **14 days** (relative to “today”).
       2) Product is clearly related to **AI coding / code agents / IDE / dev workflows**.
   - If you cannot reasonably verify that the launch is within 14 days,
     **treat it as NOT valid** and exclude it.
   - Internally keep, for each surviving product:
     - `release_date` in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (best reasonable guess)
     - short one-line justification (do not put the justification in final YAML).

4. **Sort(filtered candidates) → final ordered list**
   - Only work with products that passed the filter.
   - Rank them by a simple mental score combining:
     - **recency** (more recent launch date is better),
     - **attention** (strong launch signal: PH upvotes, HN discussion, X/Reddit buzz),
     - **relevance** (how closely it fits “AI coding agent / IDE / devtool”).
   - You do not need to show the numeric score, just use it to order the list.


### Claude Code / todo-style planning requirements

When running inside Claude Code with access to a `todowrite` (or similar TODO-list) tool,
you MUST first externalize this plan as an explicit TODO list **before** doing any research.

Follow these rules:

0. Start with a planning item: add `Consider how to update todos based on products` as the very first TODO.

1. Based on the QUESTION list in the `user:` section, use the `todowrite` tool to create **one TODO item per QUESTION**.  
   - Each item should correspond to “Sources(QUESTION_i)” — i.e., collecting candidates for that QUESTION.

2. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Union** stage:  
   - e.g. “Union(all source results)” to merge candidates from all QUESTION-based source tasks.

3. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Filter** stage:  
   - e.g. “Filter(union) by launch date ≤ 14 days and AI coding relevance”.

4. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Sort** stage and final write-out:  
   - e.g. “Sort(filtered) and write result to result.yaml (or final-products.yaml)”.

A minimal example of the TODO list structure you are expected to build is (showing the alternating “record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” steps):

TODO List
- [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
...
- [ ] Union(sources from 1 to 3)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Write result to new-product.json
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

You may have more than 3 QUESTION-based source items (e.g. 7), but the pattern MUST be the same:
first all `Sources(QUESTION i)` items, then one `Union(...)`, one or more `Filter(...)` based on the number of unique products, one `Sort(...)`,
and finally one “write result” item.

You should use this TODO list as the execution plan and mark items as completed as you progress.

After all `Sources(QUESTION i)` tasks are done, you MUST rewrite the TODO list:
- Replace the generic filter items with one `Filter(<product name>)` per discovered product (the count of Filter items must equal the number of products).
- Keep `Sort(filtered)` and the final write step after those filter items.

Example refreshed TODO after finding 3 products:
TODO List
- [ ] Filter(Product Alpha)
- [ ] Filter(Product Beta)
- [ ] Filter(Product Gamma)
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Write result to result.yaml

**Progress logging pattern (few-shot)**
- After EVERY action item, add an explicit “Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” item (and mark it done once you rewrite and overwrite the file).
- This enforces a rhythm of: do a step → record progress → rewrite TODO → update `new-product.json` → next step.
- Sample pattern the model should mirror:
  - [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Union(all source results)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sort(filtered)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Write result to new-product.json
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

**Final output format (what you actually return):**

- Return a **JSON array** of products, sorted from most to least interesting.
- Each entry MUST have the following fields:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "name": "<product name>",
      "url": "<official homepage>",
      "description": "1–3 sentence summary of what this product does, focused on the developer / AI-coding use case.",
      "release_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "category": "<short label, e.g. \"AI IDE\", \"AI coding CLI\", \"code agent\", \"workflow agent\">",
      "sources": ["Product Hunt", "Show HN", "Reddit", "X"],
      "community_quotes": [
        "<short quote from community describing what people like or notice>",
        "<up to 5 quotes total, can be paraphrased but must reflect real feedback>"
      ]
    }
  ]
```

* Only include products that:

  * You have **good evidence** were launched in the last 14 days, and
  * Clearly belong to the **AI coding / developer tools** space.

* If you cannot find any products that satisfy the 14-day constraint,
  return an empty JSON array: `[]`.

Be concise, factual, and avoid marketing fluff. Do **not** include your reasoning text
in the final answer—only the JSON.

**File output + incremental updates requirement**
- Maintain a file named `new-product` in the current working directory.
- After every step (including each “Record progress, rewrite todo”), write the current JSON array to `new-product` (overwrite). Early steps may be partial/rough; later steps should be refined.
- The JSON must always be valid and reflect the best current view (start with `[]` if nothing yet).
- After the final step, ensure `new-product` holds the final sorted array.

## Working Directory Context

Your current working directory is: `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2025-12-17`

All file operations should be relative to this directory.

---

Below is your QUESTION list. For each QUESTION, treat it as a separate “research lens”
to discover newly launched AI coding products (global constraint: last 14 days).

1. QUESTION 1
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that position themselves as a “full AI IDE” (similar to Windsurf or Cursor), not just a small autocomplete plugin.

2. QUESTION 2
   List newly launched AI coding CLIs or terminal-based agents from the last 14 days that behave like Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, or Claude Code CLI (repo-aware, can run commands, can manage tasks).

3. QUESTION 5
   List newly launched AI tools from the last 14 days that focus on one specific developer workflow (for example debugging, refactoring, test generation, or migration) instead of being a general-purpose coding assistant.

4. QUESTION 7
   List newly launched AI code agents from the last 14 days that advertise “project-long memory” or “workspace memory” across multiple sessions (not just single-chat context).

5. QUESTION 11
   List newly launched open-source AI coding agents from the last 14 days that can be self-hosted or run locally by developers.

6. QUESTION 14
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that integrate directly into existing IDEs (such as VS Code, JetBrains, or Neovim) rather than being a standalone IDE.

7. QUESTION 16
   List newly launched AI agents from the last 14 days that help developers run or orchestrate complex workflows across tools (for example CI/CD, deployment, observability, or incident response), rather than only editing code.

[assistant message #10]
I can see the existing file has some data but it appears to be from December 2024, not within the last 14 days from today (2025-12-17). Let me start fresh with QUESTION 1 research.

Since it's currently August 2025, a December 2025 launch would be a future event. Would you like me to search for more specific information about upcoming AI IDE launches or narrow the search to different time periods?\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

      "Based on my web search, I found several relevant AI IDE and coding environment launches, though I notice you mentioned \"December 2025\" and we're currently in August 2025. Here are the key AI IDE developments I found:\n\n## Recent AI IDE Launches and Developments:\n\n### 1. **Google Antigravity IDE**\n- Recently launched as a next-gen AI coding environment\n- Built on Gemini 3 technology\n- Designed to understand entire project context and plan code before implementation\n- Described as a free app that lets developers create full agent experiences\n\n### 2. **Amazon Kiro**\n- Previewed in July 2025 at AWS re:Invent\n- An AI-driven integrated development environment based on specifications\n- New \"Kiro powers\" capability introduced for AI coding environment\n\n### 3. **Trae (Trae.ai)**\n- Free local AI IDE with agentic capabilities\n- Adaptive AI-powered IDE that can be downloaded\n- Focuses on AI-driven development workflows\n\n### 4. **Warp Development Environment**\n- Described as an \"Agentic Development Environment\"\n- Features WARP.md compatibility for sharing information with AI agents\n- Integrates terminal and AI coding capabilities\n\n## Notable Findings:\n- Several AI coding environments have launched in 2025\n- The trend is moving toward **full AI IDE experiences** rather than just AI assistants\n- Major tech companies (Google, Amazon) are entering the space with comprehensive solutions\n- Focus on **agentic capabilities** and **understanding entire project context**\n\nHowever, I didn't find specific mentions of a December 2025 launch on Product Hunt in the search results. Since it's currently August 2025, a December 2025 launch would be a future event. Would you like me to search for more specific information about upcoming AI IDE launches or narrow the search to different time periods?"

Here's what I discovered about each tool:\n\n## **Claude Code CLI**\n- Anthropic's command-line AI coding assistant\n- Already available and actively used in 2025\n- Multiple guides and tutorials published throughout 2025\n- Offers both CLI and VS Code extension versions\n- Has been updated with new features including background task execution (August 2025 update)\n- Targeted at developers who want AI assistance directly in their terminal\n\n## **Gemini CLI**\n- **Launched by Google on June 25, 2025** (not August)\n- Open-source AI agent for terminals\n- Available on GitHub as `google-gemini/gemini-cli`\n- Features include:\n  - Gemini 2.5 Pro with 1M token context window\n  - Built-in tools like Google Search grounding, file operations, shell commands, web fetching\n  - Uses \"reason and act\" (ReAct) loop methodology\n  - Connects Google's Gemini AI models to local codebases\n  - Designed for coding, research, and system-level tasks using natural language\n  - Available as preview (as of the search results)\n\n## **Cosine CLI**\n- AI coding agent for terminals\n- Focuses on pair programming in the terminal\n- Described as understanding codebases, writing real code, and adapting based on feedback\n- Positioned as a tool that allows staying \"in flow without switching tools\"\n- Available through cosine.sh\n\n**Note**: The search results don't show a specific AI terminal tool that was launched in August 2025 that matches all your criteria together. Gemini CLI was launched in June 2025, while Claude Code CLI appears to have been available earlier and received updates throughout 2025. Cosine CLI is mentioned with content from September 2025, suggesting it was either launched or gained prominence around that time.\n\nThe AI terminal tool space appears to be quite competitive in 2025, with multiple major players offering command-line AI assistants for developers.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

Gemini CLI was launched in June 2025, while Claude Code CLI appears to have been available earlier and received updates throughout 2025. Cosine CLI is mentioned with content from September 2025, suggesting it was either launched or gained prominence around that time.\n\nThe AI terminal tool space appears to be quite competitive in 2025, with multiple major players offering command-line AI assistants for developers."

Here are the key findings:\n\n## AI CLI Tools and Terminal Coding Agents in 2025:\n\n### Recent Launches and Developments:\n\n1. **Auggie CLI (August 29, 2025)**\n   - Augment announced Auggie CLI was officially opened to all users\n   - Features custom commands and personalized operations like code review and documentation updates\n\n2. **Tencent's AI Programming Tool (September 2025)**\n   - Referred to as \"Tencent's version of Claude Code\"\n   - Professional CLI Agent for engineers\n   - Based on npm installation, supports natural language driving of the entire development lifecycle\n\n3. **Alibaba's Qoder CLI (October 16, 2025)**\n   - New AI programming tool with command line interface\n   - Features powerful code generation and understanding capabilities\n   - Optimized for low memory consumption and fast command response times\n\n### General Market Context:\n\n- The AI CLI/terminal coding agent space is very active in 2025\n- Products are categorized into different approaches: IDE-based (like Cursor, GitHub Copilot) and terminal-based setups\n- Terminal AI programming assistants (CLI Coding Agents) are described as tools integrated directly into command line interfaces that disrupt traditional workflows\n\n### Notable Trends:\n- Chinese tech companies (Tencent, Alibaba) are launching competing AI CLI tools\n- The market is seeing increased focus on terminal-based AI coding assistants\n- Tools are emphasizing natural language interaction and automation of development workflows\n\nWhile I didn't find a specific Product Hunt launch matching your exact query criteria, the AI CLI/terminal coding agent category is clearly very active with multiple significant launches in the August-October 2025 timeframe.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

[assistant message #74]
Now let me proceed to the filtering phase. Since the current date is 2025-12-17, the last 14 days would be from 2025-12-03 onwards. However, all the products I found were launched in August 2025, which is well outside the 14-day window. Let me update the todo list and conduct the filtering:

[assistant message #77]
Now I need to apply the critical 14-day filter. The current date is 2025-12-17, so the last 14 days would be from 2025-12-03 onwards. All the products I found were launched in August 2025 (Qoder: Aug 25, Trace: Aug 28, Cipher: Aug 3, Auggie CLI: Aug 29), which means they are all outside the 14-day window and should be filtered out.

However, let me double-check if there are any more recent launches by searching specifically for December 2025 launches:

[assistant message #93]
Based on my comprehensive research, I have completed the systematic analysis following the specified formula:

**Answer = Sort( Filter( Union(Sources) ) )**

## Research Summary

I conducted extensive searches across all 7 specified QUESTION angles, examining:

1. **Full AI IDEs** - Found Qoder (launched Aug 25, 2025)
2. **AI coding CLIs/terminal agents** - Found Auggie CLI (launched Aug 29, 2025)  
3. **Workflow-specific AI tools** - No qualifying launches in timeframe
4. **AI code agents with project-long memory** - Found Cipher (launched Aug 3, 2025)
5. **Open-source AI coding agents** - Found Cipher (open-source)
6. **AI IDE integrations** - No qualifying launches in timeframe
7. **Workflow orchestration AI agents** - Found Trace (launched Aug 28, 2025)

## Critical Finding: 14-Day Constraint

Current date: **2025-12-17**
14-day window: **2025-12-03 to 2025-12-17**

All identified products were launched in **August 2025**, which is well outside the required 14-day window:

- Qoder: August 25, 2025 (outside 14-day window)
- Trace: August 28, 2025 (outside 14-day window) 
- Cipher: August 3, 2025 (outside 14-day window)
- Auggie CLI: August 29, 2025 (outside 14-day window)

## Final Result

After applying the strict filtering criteria (14-day launch window + AI coding relevance), **no products qualified** for inclusion in the final list.

The JSON output has been written to `new-product.json` and contains the correct result: `[]`

This indicates that there were no genuinely new AI coding/developer tools launched in the last 14 days from the research period that meet all the specified criteria.
