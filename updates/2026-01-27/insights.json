    "title": "Andrej Karpathy's Dramatic Reversal: Now Codes 'Mostly in English' with AI Agents",
    "description": "In a stunning reversal from his October 2025 skepticism when he said AI agents 'just don't work,' Andrej Karpathy reports that 80% of his coding is now agent-based. He describes it as 'the biggest change to my basic coding workflow in ~2 decades.' Karpathy shifted from 80% manual/20% AI in November 2025 to 80% AI/20% manual by December 2025. Despite the enthusiasm, he warns models still make 'subtle conceptual errors that a slightly sloppy, hasty junior dev might do' - they make wrong assumptions, don't manage confusion, don't seek clarifications, and overcomplicate solutions. He predicts a 2026 'slopacolypse' of low-quality AI-generated code across GitHub and other platforms.",

    "description": "Simon Willison shares his predictions for 2026 on the Oxide and Friends podcast. Key predictions: 1 year - 'It will become undeniable that LLMs write good code'; 1 year - 'We're finally going to solve sandboxing'; 1 year - A 'Challenger disaster' for coding agent security; 3 years - The coding agents Jevons paradox will resolve; 3 years - Someone will build a new browser using mainly AI-assisted coding; 6 years - 'Typing code by hand will go the way of punch cards.' Willison bases his code quality prediction on extensive hands-on experience, noting that since Claude Opus 4.5 and GPT-5.2 came out in November/December 2025, 'the amount of code I've written by hand has dropped to a single digit percentage of my overall output.'",

    "description": "Replit CEO Amjad Masad emphasizes a key differentiator for Replit's approach: transparency. Unlike many AI coding tools that abstract away or hide the code, Replit keeps code visible and editable. This philosophy aligns with Replit's dramatic growth from $10M to $100M ARR in just 9 months, driven by their AI coding tools. Masad's vision focuses on democratizing software development and making programming accessible to 1 billion developers worldwide, while maintaining the fundamental connection between developers and their code.",
