    "description": "IBM experts analyze the 2025 AI agent landscape: 99% of surveyed developers are exploring or developing AI agents. However, current 'agents' are primarily LLMs with function calling capabilities, not truly autonomous systems. The year 2025 will be one of experimentation, with enterprises needing proper governance, traceability, and audit trails before widespread adoption. Key insight: Most organizations aren't 'agent-ready'—the challenge is exposing enterprise APIs, not model capabilities.",
