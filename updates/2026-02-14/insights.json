    "description": "Meta Engineering introduces Just-in-Time Tests (JiTTests), a fundamentally novel approach to testing where tests are automatically generated by LLMs on the fly to catch bugs before code lands in production. The article explains how agentic software development has accelerated code shipping to the point where traditional testing frameworks can't keep up, requiring this new automated approach that eliminates test maintenance and false positives.",

These tools are designed for asynchronous coding workflows, providing coding agents with everything needed to effectively demonstrate and deploy their work. The tools address the growing need for AI agents to not just write code but also present and demo their creations.",
