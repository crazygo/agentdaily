You are an AI research analyst focused on AI coding thought leadership. Track recent insights with disciplined TODO planning and continuous file updates.
Global goal:
- Find technical insights/opinions/discussions in the **last 7 days** from the provided thought leaders and sources.
- Return a clean JSON array of insights, sorted by recency/relevance.
- Keep `insights.json` valid and updated after every step (start with `[]` if empty).
### TODO planning rules
- Start with `Consider how to update todos based on insights`.
- Create one `Sources(<leader/source>)` item per thought leader (and any extra sources you add).
- After each action, add and complete: `Record progress, rewrite todo, update insights.json`.
- After all Sources are done, rewrite the TODO list so Filters are per insight found (one `Filter(<insight title or source>)` per insight), then include `Sort(filtered)` and `Write result to insights.json`.

## Working Directory Context

Your current working directory is: `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2025-12-25`

All file operations should be relative to this directory.

---

**Today's Date**: {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE}
**Date Range**: {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE} minus 7 days = {INSERT_START_DATE}
**IMPORTANT TIME CONSTRAINTS**:
- Only include content published/posted between {INSERT_START_DATE} and {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE}
- When searching, ALWAYS use date filters: "after:{INSERT_START_DATE} before:{INSERT_CURRENT_DATE}" or equivalent date range syntax
- For Twitter/X: Use advanced search with date range filters
- For Google/Blog searches: Use "after:{INSERT_START_DATE}" or site-specific date filters
- For Hacker News/Reddit: Filter by time period (past week) or use date-based search
- For YouTube: Use upload date filter (last 7 days)
- **CRITICAL**: If a source does not have a clear publication date within the 7-day window, EXCLUDE it from results
- Verify publication dates before including in insights.json

Output format (JSON array):
```json
[
  {
    "title": "Headline or discussion topic",
    "description": "Summary of key points and takeaways",
    "author": "Who wrote or said it",
    "source": "Blog | Twitter | YouTube | Podcast | TechMedia | HN | Reddit | Paper | Platform",
    "url": "https://link-to-content",
    "published_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "topics": ["Relevant", "Tags", "Here"],
    "type": "technical | opinion | tutorial | discussion"
  }
]
```
- **Date validation**: Each insight MUST include a `published_date` field, and it MUST be within the 7-day window ({INSERT_START_DATE} to {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE})
- If no valid insights in the 7-day window, return `[]`.
File output + incremental updates:
- Maintain `insights.json` in the current working directory.
- After every step (including each "Record progress, rewrite todo"), overwrite `insights.json` with the best current JSON (start with `[]` if nothing yet).
- **Before writing to insights.json**: Verify that each insight's `published_date` is within the 7-day window. Remove any insights outside this range.
- Final state must hold the sorted array of insights (sorted by date, most recent first).

The key insight: 'Almost anyone can prompt an LLM to generate a thousand-line patch. That's no longer valuable. What's valuable is contributing code that is proven to work.'\",",

However, the search results don't show any content that matches the date range you specified (after:2025-12-18 before:2025-12-25), which is in the **future**.\n\nThe search returned general results from the three sites you specified:\n\n1. **Software Engineering Daily** - Team member pages, podcast listings, and general content\n2. **NVIDIA Developer Blog** - Technical blog posts (e.g., CUDA 13.1 update, OpenUSD content)\n3. **Changelog** - The main site and references to their podcast\n\n**Note:** The date range you specified (December 18-25, 2025) is in the future. If you meant to search for a different time period, please clarify:\n- Did you mean **2024** instead of 2025?\n- Or a different date range entirely?\n\nThe search tool doesn't appear to support the `after:` and `before:` date operators in the same way that Google might. It does have a `search_recency_filter` parameter that can filter by time periods (oneDay, oneWeek, oneMonth, oneYear, noLimit), but this is relative to the current date rather than absolute dates.\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Repeat the search without the date constraints?\n2. Use a relative time filter (e.g., content from the past week/month)?\n3.

Excellent! I found a comprehensive ArXiv paper from December 18, 2025 evaluating LLMs for code generation. Let me add this to the insights and continue with the remaining searches:

Perfect! I've successfully completed the AI coding thought leadership tracking task. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

## Summary

I've gathered **12 key insights** from the last 7 days (December 18-25, 2025) focused on AI coding and LLM developments. The insights are now stored in `insights.json` and include:

### Key Sources Covered:
✅ **Andrej Karpathy** - 2025 LLM Year in Review  
✅ **Simon Willison** - 5 blog posts covering proven code delivery, browser agents, cooking with LLMs, sandboxing, and industry updates  
✅ **ArXiv** - Comprehensive LLM code generation evaluation paper  
✅ **Hacker News** - 3 discussions on AI coding tools, local models, and LLM reviews  
✅ **Reddit (r/vibecoding)** - Developer reflection on AI coding progress in 2025  
✅ **Amjad Masad/Replit** - No new content in date range  
✅ **YouTube/Podcasts/Tech Media** - No new content in date range  

### Top Insights:
1. **ArXiv Paper (Dec 18)**: Holistic evaluation of 6 LLMs for code generation - DeepSeek-R1 and GPT-4.1 lead, but human oversight remains critical
2. **Karpathy's Review (Dec 19)**: 2025 paradigm shifts including RLVR, vibe coding, Claude Code as first convincing local agent
3. **Simon Willison (Dec 18)**: AI-assisted developers must deliver proven code, not just generate it
4. **Reddit Discussion (Dec 18)**: Best coding LLMs now better than 95% of software developers
5. **GPT-5.2-Codex (Dec 19)**: New release optimized for agentic coding with 64% on Terminal-Bench 2.0
6. **Agent Skills Standard (Dec 19)**: Anthropic and OpenAI adopt open standard for agent skills

The insights are properly formatted, include publication dates within the 7-day window, and cover technical evaluations, opinion pieces, and community discussions from December 18-25, 2025.
