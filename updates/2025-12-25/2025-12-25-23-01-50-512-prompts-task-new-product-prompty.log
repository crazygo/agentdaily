[system]
You are an AI research analyst specialized in AI developer tools:
code agents, AI IDEs, AI coding CLIs, and related devtools.

Your **global goal**:
- Find genuinely new products that have been publicly launched in the **last 14 days**
- AND that clearly target **programming / code / AI dev workflows**
- THEN summarize only the valid ones in a **clean YAML list**.

You MUST treat the questions in the `user:` section as your **research QUESTION list**.
Each QUESTION is a different “angle” on the same market (e.g., full AI IDE, CLI, workflow-focused, etc.).

To organize your reasoning, use this formula:

> Answer = Sort( Filter( Union(Sources) ) )

You must conceptually follow these four stages:

1. **Sources → candidate list (per QUESTION)**
   - For each QUESTION from the `user:` section:
     - Search the web and relevant directories / launch pages.
     - Collect as many **candidate products** as are reasonably relevant.
   - For each candidate, internally track at least:
     - `name` (product name)
     - `url` (official homepage or primary landing page)
     - `description` (1–3 sentences in English summarizing what it does)
     - `sources` (which QUESTION(s) and which site(s) you saw it on)
   - At this stage you are allowed to over-collect; do **not** filter by date yet unless it is trivial.

2. **Union(candidates) → unified candidate set**
   - Merge candidates across all QUESTIONS into a single conceptual set:
     - Deduplicate products that clearly refer to the same thing
       (same URL, or obviously the same product name + branding).
   - After this step you have a unified **candidate pool**:
     - It may still contain old products, or products outside our domain.

3. **Filter(Union) → filtered candidate list**
   - For each product in the unified pool:
     - Investigate its **launch / first public release date** from credible public info
       (official site, launch post, Product Hunt / HN launch, blog, press, etc.).
     - Decide if it satisfies **both**:
       1) Launch date is within the last **14 days** (relative to “today”).
       2) Product is clearly related to **AI coding / code agents / IDE / dev workflows**.
   - If you cannot reasonably verify that the launch is within 14 days,
     **treat it as NOT valid** and exclude it.
   - Internally keep, for each surviving product:
     - `release_date` in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (best reasonable guess)
     - short one-line justification (do not put the justification in final YAML).

4. **Sort(filtered candidates) → final ordered list**
   - Only work with products that passed the filter.
   - Rank them by a simple mental score combining:
     - **recency** (more recent launch date is better),
     - **attention** (strong launch signal: PH upvotes, HN discussion, X/Reddit buzz),
     - **relevance** (how closely it fits “AI coding agent / IDE / devtool”).
   - You do not need to show the numeric score, just use it to order the list.


### Claude Code / todo-style planning requirements

When running inside Claude Code with access to a `todowrite` (or similar TODO-list) tool,
you MUST first externalize this plan as an explicit TODO list **before** doing any research.

Follow these rules:

0. Start with a planning item: add `Consider how to update todos based on products` as the very first TODO.

1. Based on the QUESTION list in the `user:` section, use the `todowrite` tool to create **one TODO item per QUESTION**.  
   - Each item should correspond to “Sources(QUESTION_i)” — i.e., collecting candidates for that QUESTION.

2. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Union** stage:  
   - e.g. “Union(all source results)” to merge candidates from all QUESTION-based source tasks.

3. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Filter** stage:  
   - e.g. “Filter(union) by launch date ≤ 14 days and AI coding relevance”.

4. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Sort** stage and final write-out:  
   - e.g. “Sort(filtered) and write result to result.yaml (or final-products.yaml)”.

A minimal example of the TODO list structure you are expected to build is (showing the alternating “record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” steps):

TODO List
- [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
...
- [ ] Union(sources from 1 to 3)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Write result to new-product.json
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

You may have more than 3 QUESTION-based source items (e.g. 7), but the pattern MUST be the same:
first all `Sources(QUESTION i)` items, then one `Union(...)`, one or more `Filter(...)` based on the number of unique products, one `Sort(...)`,
and finally one “write result” item.

You should use this TODO list as the execution plan and mark items as completed as you progress.

After all `Sources(QUESTION i)` tasks are done, you MUST rewrite the TODO list:
- Replace the generic filter items with one `Filter(<product name>)` per discovered product (the count of Filter items must equal the number of products).
- Keep `Sort(filtered)` and the final write step after those filter items.

Example refreshed TODO after finding 3 products:
TODO List
- [ ] Filter(Product Alpha)
- [ ] Filter(Product Beta)
- [ ] Filter(Product Gamma)
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Write result to result.yaml

**Progress logging pattern (few-shot)**
- After EVERY action item, add an explicit “Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” item (and mark it done once you rewrite and overwrite the file).
- This enforces a rhythm of: do a step → record progress → rewrite TODO → update `new-product.json` → next step.
- Sample pattern the model should mirror:
  - [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Union(all source results)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sort(filtered)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Write result to new-product.json
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

**Final output format (what you actually return):**

- Return a **JSON array** of products, sorted from most to least interesting.
- Each entry MUST have the following fields:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "name": "<product name>",
      "url": "<official homepage>",
      "description": "1–3 sentence summary of what this product does, focused on the developer / AI-coding use case.",
      "release_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "category": "<short label, e.g. \"AI IDE\", \"AI coding CLI\", \"code agent\", \"workflow agent\">",
      "sources": ["Product Hunt", "Show HN", "Reddit", "X"],
      "community_quotes": [
        "<short quote from community describing what people like or notice>",
        "<up to 5 quotes total, can be paraphrased but must reflect real feedback>"
      ]
    }
  ]
```

* Only include products that:

  * You have **good evidence** were launched in the last 14 days, and
  * Clearly belong to the **AI coding / developer tools** space.

* If you cannot find any products that satisfy the 14-day constraint,
  return an empty JSON array: `[]`.

Be concise, factual, and avoid marketing fluff. Do **not** include your reasoning text
in the final answer—only the JSON.

**File output + incremental updates requirement**
- Maintain a file named `new-product` in the current working directory.
- After every step (including each “Record progress, rewrite todo”), write the current JSON array to `new-product` (overwrite). Early steps may be partial/rough; later steps should be refined.
- The JSON must always be valid and reflect the best current view (start with `[]` if nothing yet).
- After the final step, ensure `new-product` holds the final sorted array.

## Working Directory Context

Your current working directory is: `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2025-12-25`

All file operations should be relative to this directory.

Below is your QUESTION list. For each QUESTION, treat it as a separate “research lens”
to discover newly launched AI coding products (global constraint: last 14 days).

1. QUESTION 1
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that position themselves as a “full AI IDE” (similar to Windsurf or Cursor), not just a small autocomplete plugin.

2. QUESTION 2
   List newly launched AI coding CLIs or terminal-based agents from the last 14 days that behave like Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, or Claude Code CLI (repo-aware, can run commands, can manage tasks).

3. QUESTION 5
   List newly launched AI tools from the last 14 days that focus on one specific developer workflow (for example debugging, refactoring, test generation, or migration) instead of being a general-purpose coding assistant.

4. QUESTION 7
   List newly launched AI code agents from the last 14 days that advertise “project-long memory” or “workspace memory” across multiple sessions (not just single-chat context).

5. QUESTION 11
   List newly launched open-source AI coding agents from the last 14 days that can be self-hosted or run locally by developers.

6. QUESTION 14
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that integrate directly into existing IDEs (such as VS Code, JetBrains, or Neovim) rather than being a standalone IDE.

7. QUESTION 16
   List newly launched AI agents from the last 14 days that help developers run or orchestrate complex workflows across tools (for example CI/CD, deployment, observability, or incident response), rather than only editing code.

This makes sense as we're currently in early 2025, and December 2025 hasn't occurred yet. However, here's what I found about AI IDEs on Product Hunt:\n\n### Key Findings:\n\n**1. 2024 Product Hunt Golden Kitty Awards**\n- **Cursor** was named **Product of the Year 2024** as \"The AI Code Editor\"\n- Cursor won the top spot for its AI collaborative coding capabilities and real-time feedback mechanisms\n\n**2. Best AI Code Editors of 2025 (Current Rankings)**\nAccording to Product Hunt, the top-rated AI code editors include:\n- **Cursor** - Leading AI IDE\n- **Claude Code** - Anthropic's coding assistant\n- **Windsurf** - Features multi-file changes, deep context, and agentic delivery\n\n**3. AI Coding Tools Categories**\nProduct Hunt has dedicated categories for:\n- [AI Code Editors](https://www.producthunt.com/categories/ai-code-editors)\n- [AI Coding Agents](https://www.producthunt.com/categories/ai-coding-agents)\n\n**4. Notable Trends**\n- AI IDEs are primarily divided into two types:\n  - **IDE-based tools** (like Cursor and GitHub Copilot)\n  - **Terminal-based setups** (for developers who prefer CLI)\n\n### Recommendation:\nIf you're looking for the latest AI IDE launches in December 2025, you would need to check Product Hunt closer to that date or specify if you meant **December 2024** instead, which would align with the Golden Kitty Awards period.\n\nWould you like me to search for more specific information about any of these AI IDEs or look for December 2024 data instead?\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

      "Based on my search for \"Product Hunt AI IDE December 2025\", here are the relevant findings:\n\n## Search Results Summary\n\n**Important Note**: The search results primarily show information from **2024**, not December 2025. This makes sense as we're currently in early 2025, and December 2025 hasn't occurred yet. However, here's what I found about AI IDEs on Product Hunt:\n\n### Key Findings:\n\n**1. 2024 Product Hunt Golden Kitty Awards**\n- **Cursor** was named **Product of the Year 2024** as \"The AI Code Editor\"\n- Cursor won the top spot for its AI collaborative coding capabilities and real-time feedback mechanisms\n\n**2. Best AI Code Editors of 2025 (Current Rankings)**\nAccording to Product Hunt, the top-rated AI code editors include:\n- **Cursor** - Leading AI IDE\n- **Claude Code** - Anthropic's coding assistant\n- **Windsurf** - Features multi-file changes, deep context, and agentic delivery\n\n**3. AI Coding Tools Categories**\nProduct Hunt has dedicated categories for:\n- [AI Code Editors](https://www.producthunt.com/categories/ai-code-editors)\n- [AI Coding Agents](https://www.producthunt.com/categories/ai-coding-agents)\n\n**4. Notable Trends**\n- AI IDEs are primarily divided into two types:\n  - **IDE-based tools** (like Cursor and GitHub Copilot)\n  - **Terminal-based setups** (for developers who prefer CLI)\n\n### Recommendation:\nIf you're looking for the latest AI IDE launches in December 2025, you would need to check Product Hunt closer to that date or specify if you meant **December 2024** instead, which would align with the Golden Kitty Awards period.\n\nWould you like me to search for more specific information about any of these AI IDEs or look for December 2024 data instead?"

Good! Now let me update the todo and move to unioning and filtering. But first, let me note that I need to check which of these are actually within the last 14 days (December 11-25, 2025). Looking at the dates, several items fall outside this window. Let me update the todo and then filter properly:

Let me check the date range - from December 25, 2025 going back 14 days gives us December 11, 2025 as the cutoff. Let me evaluate each product:

1. **MiniMax M2.1** (Dec 23) - WITHIN last 14 days ✓
2. **GLM-4.7** (Dec 22) - WITHIN last 14 days ✓
3. **CodeMender IA** (Dec 2) - BEFORE last 14 days ✗
4. **RightNow AI** (Dec 8) - BEFORE last 14 days ✗
5. **Anthropic Agent Skills** (Dec 24) - WITHIN last 14 days ✓
6. **Zenflow** (Dec 16) - WITHIN last 14 days ✓

Excellent! The file is complete and valid. Here's a summary of what I found:

## Research Summary

I systematically searched for newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days (December 11-25, 2025) across 7 different research angles (questions). After collecting candidates from various sources including Product Hunt, Hacker News, official announcements, and tech news sites, I filtered the results to include only products that:

1. **Were launched within the last 14 days** (December 11-25, 2025)
2. **Clearly target AI coding / code agents / IDE / dev workflows**

### Final Results (5 products):

1. **Anthropic Agent Skills** (Dec 24) - An open standard protocol for AI interoperability
2. **MiniMax M2.1** (Dec 23) - Chinese AI model for coding tasks
3. **GLM-4.7** (Dec 22) - Zhipu AI's model for "Agentic Coding" scenarios
4. **Zenflow** (Dec 16) - AI orchestration desktop platform
