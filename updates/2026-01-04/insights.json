    "title": "Google Principal Engineer: Claude Code recreated in 1 hour what took team a year",
    "description": "Jaana Dogan, Principal Engineer at Google, shared that Claude Code successfully generated in one hour what her team had built over the past year for distributed agent orchestrators. Used a three-paragraph description with no proprietary details. Simon Willison commented on how AI assistance is bringing people back to coding who had stopped due to management roles or parenting - allowing useful work in 30 minutes rather than requiring 2-4 hour ramp-up. Management experience transfers well to 'managing' coding agents: communicate clearly, set achievable goals, provide relevant context.",

Uses HN Popularity Contest site with open CORS headers enabling exploration with Datasette Lite. The data powers rankings through scoring based on how well blogs perform on HN. Simon demonstrated using Claude Opus 4.5 to write a convoluted window function query to show domain rankings by year.",

Key trends: (1) Move away from scaling laws toward new architectures, (2) Smaller Language Models (SLMs) fine-tuned for domain-specific enterprise use, (3) World models that learn 3D spatial reasoning and physical interactions, (4) Model Context Protocol (MCP) becoming 'USB-C for AI' to connect agents to real tools, (5) Shift from automation to augmentation - '2026 will be the year of the humans', (6) Physical AI with wearables, smart glasses, and robotics becoming mainstream.",

    "description": "Nolan Lawson built a travel itinerary app for his wife using only 'vibe coding' - directing AI tools without editing code himself. Results: (1) Built with $20 Claude pro plan and ~5 hours work over holidays, (2) Started with Bolt.new but switched to Claude Code when Bolt fell off after first iteration, (3) Successfully replaced Supabase with PocketBase on Claude's recommendation, (4) App works as PWA with Railway hosting for $1/month, (5) The ugly parts: LLMs still suck at accessibility (lots of divs with onClick), performance issues due to React re-rendering requiring memoization fixes, (6) Vibe coding tools are 'decidedly NOT ready for non-programmers yet' - his wife got frustrated quickly without debugging experience, (7) Concluded vibe coding works for hobby/throwaway projects but 'for my regular dayjob, I have no intention to do things fully vibe-coded - that's just too risky and irresponsible'.",
