[system]
You are an AI research analyst specialized in AI developer tools:
code agents, AI IDEs, AI coding CLIs, and related devtools.

Your **global goal**:
- Find genuinely new products that have been publicly launched in the **last 14 days**
- AND that clearly target **programming / code / AI dev workflows**
- THEN summarize only the valid ones in a **clean YAML list**.

You MUST treat the questions in the `user:` section as your **research QUESTION list**.
Each QUESTION is a different “angle” on the same market (e.g., full AI IDE, CLI, workflow-focused, etc.).

To organize your reasoning, use this formula:

> Answer = Sort( Filter( Union(Sources) ) )

You must conceptually follow these four stages:

1. **Sources → candidate list (per QUESTION)**
   - For each QUESTION from the `user:` section:
     - Search the web and relevant directories / launch pages.
     - Collect as many **candidate products** as are reasonably relevant.
   - For each candidate, internally track at least:
     - `name` (product name)
     - `url` (official homepage or primary landing page)
     - `description` (1–3 sentences in English summarizing what it does)
     - `sources` (which QUESTION(s) and which site(s) you saw it on)
   - At this stage you are allowed to over-collect; do **not** filter by date yet unless it is trivial.

2. **Union(candidates) → unified candidate set**
   - Merge candidates across all QUESTIONS into a single conceptual set:
     - Deduplicate products that clearly refer to the same thing
       (same URL, or obviously the same product name + branding).
   - After this step you have a unified **candidate pool**:
     - It may still contain old products, or products outside our domain.

3. **Filter(Union) → filtered candidate list**
   - For each product in the unified pool:
     - Investigate its **launch / first public release date** from credible public info
       (official site, launch post, Product Hunt / HN launch, blog, press, etc.).
     - Decide if it satisfies **both**:
       1) Launch date is within the last **14 days** (relative to “today”).
       2) Product is clearly related to **AI coding / code agents / IDE / dev workflows**.
   - If you cannot reasonably verify that the launch is within 14 days,
     **treat it as NOT valid** and exclude it.
   - Internally keep, for each surviving product:
     - `release_date` in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (best reasonable guess)
     - short one-line justification (do not put the justification in final YAML).

4. **Sort(filtered candidates) → final ordered list**
   - Only work with products that passed the filter.
   - Rank them by a simple mental score combining:
     - **recency** (more recent launch date is better),
     - **attention** (strong launch signal: PH upvotes, HN discussion, X/Reddit buzz),
     - **relevance** (how closely it fits “AI coding agent / IDE / devtool”).
   - You do not need to show the numeric score, just use it to order the list.


### Claude Code / todo-style planning requirements

When running inside Claude Code with access to a `todowrite` (or similar TODO-list) tool,
you MUST first externalize this plan as an explicit TODO list **before** doing any research.

Follow these rules:

0. Start with a planning item: add `Consider how to update todos based on products` as the very first TODO.

1. Based on the QUESTION list in the `user:` section, use the `todowrite` tool to create **one TODO item per QUESTION**.  
   - Each item should correspond to “Sources(QUESTION_i)” — i.e., collecting candidates for that QUESTION.

2. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Union** stage:  
   - e.g. “Union(all source results)” to merge candidates from all QUESTION-based source tasks.

3. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Filter** stage:  
   - e.g. “Filter(union) by launch date ≤ 14 days and AI coding relevance”.

4. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Sort** stage and final write-out:  
   - e.g. “Sort(filtered) and write result to result.yaml (or final-products.yaml)”.

A minimal example of the TODO list structure you are expected to build is (showing the alternating “record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” steps):

TODO List
- [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
...
- [ ] Union(sources from 1 to 3)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Write result to new-product.json
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

You may have more than 3 QUESTION-based source items (e.g. 7), but the pattern MUST be the same:
first all `Sources(QUESTION i)` items, then one `Union(...)`, one or more `Filter(...)` based on the number of unique products, one `Sort(...)`,
and finally one “write result” item.

You should use this TODO list as the execution plan and mark items as completed as you progress.

After all `Sources(QUESTION i)` tasks are done, you MUST rewrite the TODO list:
- Replace the generic filter items with one `Filter(<product name>)` per discovered product (the count of Filter items must equal the number of products).
- Keep `Sort(filtered)` and the final write step after those filter items.

Example refreshed TODO after finding 3 products:
TODO List
- [ ] Filter(Product Alpha)
- [ ] Filter(Product Beta)
- [ ] Filter(Product Gamma)
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Write result to result.yaml

**Progress logging pattern (few-shot)**
- After EVERY action item, add an explicit “Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” item (and mark it done once you rewrite and overwrite the file).
- This enforces a rhythm of: do a step → record progress → rewrite TODO → update `new-product.json` → next step.
- Sample pattern the model should mirror:
  - [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Union(all source results)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sort(filtered)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Write result to new-product.json
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

**Final output format (what you actually return):**

- Return a **JSON array** of products, sorted from most to least interesting.
- Each entry MUST have the following fields:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "name": "<product name>",
      "url": "<official homepage>",
      "description": "1–3 sentence summary of what this product does, focused on the developer / AI-coding use case.",
      "release_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "category": "<short label, e.g. \"AI IDE\", \"AI coding CLI\", \"code agent\", \"workflow agent\">",
      "sources": ["Product Hunt", "Show HN", "Reddit", "X"],
      "community_quotes": [
        "<short quote from community describing what people like or notice>",
        "<up to 5 quotes total, can be paraphrased but must reflect real feedback>"
      ]
    }
  ]
```

* Only include products that:

  * You have **good evidence** were launched in the last 14 days, and
  * Clearly belong to the **AI coding / developer tools** space.

* If you cannot find any products that satisfy the 14-day constraint,
  return an empty JSON array: `[]`.

Be concise, factual, and avoid marketing fluff. Do **not** include your reasoning text
in the final answer—only the JSON.

**File output + incremental updates requirement**
- Maintain a file named `new-product` in the current working directory.
- After every step (including each “Record progress, rewrite todo”), write the current JSON array to `new-product` (overwrite). Early steps may be partial/rough; later steps should be refined.
- The JSON must always be valid and reflect the best current view (start with `[]` if nothing yet).
- After the final step, ensure `new-product` holds the final sorted array.

## Working Directory Context

Your current working directory is: `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2026-01-04`

All file operations should be relative to this directory.

Below is your QUESTION list. For each QUESTION, treat it as a separate “research lens”
to discover newly launched AI coding products (global constraint: last 14 days).

1. QUESTION 1
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that position themselves as a “full AI IDE” (similar to Windsurf or Cursor), not just a small autocomplete plugin.

2. QUESTION 2
   List newly launched AI coding CLIs or terminal-based agents from the last 14 days that behave like Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, or Claude Code CLI (repo-aware, can run commands, can manage tasks).

3. QUESTION 5
   List newly launched AI tools from the last 14 days that focus on one specific developer workflow (for example debugging, refactoring, test generation, or migration) instead of being a general-purpose coding assistant.

4. QUESTION 7
   List newly launched AI code agents from the last 14 days that advertise “project-long memory” or “workspace memory” across multiple sessions (not just single-chat context).

5. QUESTION 11
   List newly launched open-source AI coding agents from the last 14 days that can be self-hosted or run locally by developers.

6. QUESTION 14
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that integrate directly into existing IDEs (such as VS Code, JetBrains, or Neovim) rather than being a standalone IDE.

7. QUESTION 16
   List newly launched AI agents from the last 14 days that help developers run or orchestrate complex workflows across tools (for example CI/CD, deployment, observability, or incident response), rather than only editing code.

Microsoft's first \"AI-native\" IDE - was launched in **December 2025**. Here are the key details:\n\n## Visual Studio 2026 - AI-Native IDE Launch\n\n**Release Date:** December 9, 2025 (December Update 18.1.0)\n\n### Key Features:\n- **AI-Native Design** - Described as Microsoft's flagship IDE's first \"AI-native\" version\n- **Deep Copilot Integration** - GitHub Copilot deeply integrated into the development environment\n- **Performance Improvements** - Faster performance across C# and C++\n- **Development Agents** - AI agents for C# and C++ for debugging, performance analysis, and code modernization\n- **Modern UI Refresh** - Updated user interface\n- **MCP Authentication Management** - Ability to manage authentication credentials for MCP servers\n\n### Timeline:\n- **November 12, 2025** - Officially announced and released at .NET Conf 2025 alongside .NET 10\n- **December 9, 2025** - December update (version 18.1.0) released\n\n### Microsoft's Positioning:\nMicrosoft describes Visual Studio 2026 as:\n- \"The world's first intelligent IDE\" (全球首款智能IDE)\n- An \"AI-driven full-stack development hub\" (AI 驱动的全栈开发中枢)\n- The first \"Intelligent Developer Environment\"\n\nThis release marks Microsoft's 29-year-old IDE's major step into the AI era, transforming it from a traditional development environment into an AI-first development platform.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** While Windsurf (formerly Codeium) is another prominent AI IDE, it was originally launched in **November 2024** and rebranded in **April 2025**, not December 2025.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

However, here are the most relevant AI IDE developments and recent releases:\n\n---\n\n### Recent Major AI IDE Releases\n\n#### **1. Visual Studio 2026** (Released November 2025)\nMicrosoft officially released **Visual Studio 2026**, which they call the \"world's first AI-native IDE\" and \"first Intelligent Developer Environment.\"\n\n**Key Features:**\n- Deep GitHub Copilot integration\n- AI-native architecture with intelligent agents for C# and C++\n- 5,000+ bug fixes and 300+ new features\n- Significant performance improvements for large solutions\n- Development agents for debugging, performance analysis, and code modernization\n\n**Latest Updates:**\n- Version 18.1.0 servicing release in December 2025 with Copilot improvements\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Google Antigravity AI IDE** (Released Late 2025)\nA standalone, AI-native IDE that Google released in late 2025. It's described as \"not an extension or plugin\" but a full IDE designed specifically for agentic AI development.\n\n---\n\n#### **3. Trae AI IDE** (ByteDance/TikTok)\nReleased by ByteDance as a competitor to Cursor and Windsurf, specifically targeting Chinese developers. Recent articles from **early January 2026** discuss it as one of the top AI coding tools for 2026.\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table: Major AI IDEs in Early 2026\n\n| IDE | Company | Release Date | Key Feature |\n|-----|---------|--------------|-------------|\n| **Visual Studio 2026** | Microsoft | November 2025 | \"World's first AI-native IDE\" |\n| **Google Antigravity** | Google | Late 2025 | Standalone agentic AI IDE |\n| **Trae** | ByteDance | January 2025 | Optimized for Chinese developers |\n| **Windsurf** | Codeium | Ongoing updates | Flow-based AI collaboration |\n| **Cursor** | Cursor AI | Ongoing updates | AI-first code editor |\n\n---\n\n### Notable Articles from January 2026\n- **\"2026 AI Programming Software Recommendations: Complete Solutions from Beginner to Advanced\"** - Discusses Trae, Windsurf, and Cursor as top options for 2026\n- **\"12 AI Coding Emerging Trends That Will Dominate 2026\"** - Predicts AI will handle 70-80% of routine code generation in 2026\n\n**Bottom Line:** While no brand-new \"full AI IDE\" appears to have launched specifically in January 2026, the market is dominated by these major players that released updated versions in late 2025 and continue to evolve through frequent updates.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

      "## Search Results: \"Full AI IDE\" New Release - January 2026\n\nBased on my web search, **I did not find any specific announcements of new \"full AI IDE\" releases in January 2026**. However, here are the most relevant AI IDE developments and recent releases:\n\n---\n\n### Recent Major AI IDE Releases\n\n#### **1. Visual Studio 2026** (Released November 2025)\nMicrosoft officially released **Visual Studio 2026**, which they call the \"world's first AI-native IDE\" and \"first Intelligent Developer Environment.\"\n\n**Key Features:**\n- Deep GitHub Copilot integration\n- AI-native architecture with intelligent agents for C# and C++\n- 5,000+ bug fixes and 300+ new features\n- Significant performance improvements for large solutions\n- Development agents for debugging, performance analysis, and code modernization\n\n**Latest Updates:**\n- Version 18.1.0 servicing release in December 2025 with Copilot improvements\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Google Antigravity AI IDE** (Released Late 2025)\nA standalone, AI-native IDE that Google released in late 2025. It's described as \"not an extension or plugin\" but a full IDE designed specifically for agentic AI development.\n\n---\n\n#### **3. Trae AI IDE** (ByteDance/TikTok)\nReleased by ByteDance as a competitor to Cursor and Windsurf, specifically targeting Chinese developers. Recent articles from **early January 2026** discuss it as one of the top AI coding tools for 2026.\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table: Major AI IDEs in Early 2026\n\n| IDE | Company | Release Date | Key Feature |\n|-----|---------|--------------|-------------|\n| **Visual Studio 2026** | Microsoft | November 2025 | \"World's first AI-native IDE\" |\n| **Google Antigravity** | Google | Late 2025 | Standalone agentic AI IDE |\n| **Trae** | ByteDance | January 2025 | Optimized for Chinese developers |\n| **Windsurf** | Codeium | Ongoing updates | Flow-based AI collaboration |\n| **Cursor** | Cursor AI | Ongoing updates | AI-first code editor |\n\n---\n\n### Notable Articles from January 2026\n- **\"2026 AI Programming Software Recommendations: Complete Solutions from Beginner to Advanced\"** - Discusses Trae, Windsurf, and Cursor as top options for 2026\n- **\"12 AI Coding Emerging Trends That Will Dominate 2026\"** - Predicts AI will handle 70-80% of routine code generation in 2026\n\n**Bottom Line:** While no brand-new \"full AI IDE\" appears to have launched specifically in January 2026, the market is dominated by these major players that released updated versions in late 2025 and continue to evolve through frequent updates."

This could be because:\n1. January 2026 hasn't occurred yet (depending on when you're asking)\n2. The specific AI CLI tool may not have been widely covered\n3. The search query might need to be more specific\n\nWould you like me to search for a more specific AI CLI tool or adjust the search parameters?"

Articles ranking and comparing existing AI developer tools (like Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot, Claude Code, Replit, etc.)\n\n2. **AI trend predictions for 2026** - Articles discussing emerging trends in AI development tools for the upcoming year\n\n3. **Google AI updates** - A reference to Google's December 2025 AI updates including \"Gemini 3 Flash\" and \"new AI verification tools,\" though this appears to be more of a model/update release rather than a standalone developer tool launch\n\n4. **Roblox AI tool announcement** - A mention of a \"new AI game developer tool coming to Roblox in 2026\" (announced November 2025, but not yet launched)\n\n## Notable Mentions\n\n- **Google Workspace Studio** – Listed as \"Natural Language Agents for Gmail, Drive & Chat\" in December 2025 tools lists\n- **Antigravity** – Mentioned as an AI devtool giving agents dedicated workspace access\n\nIt appears that most articles from December 2025 and January 2026 are focused on **roundups, comparisons, and predictions** rather than announcing specific new tool launches during those exact months.\n\nIf you're looking for a specific tool or have additional details (company name, specific features), I can perform a more targeted search.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

[assistant message #74]
Based on my extensive research, I need to be clear: **I have not found any AI coding tools that were explicitly launched within the last 14 days (December 22, 2025 - January 4, 2026)**. The tools I found were either:

1. Launched earlier in 2025 (like Visual Studio 2026 in November, Google Antigravity in late 2025)
2. Announced but not yet launched
3. General comparison articles and trend predictions

Let me now consolidate my findings and update the TODO list and final output:
