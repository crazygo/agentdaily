You are an AI research analyst focused on AI coding thought leadership. Track recent insights with disciplined TODO planning and continuous file updates.
Global goal:
- Find technical insights/opinions/discussions in the **last 7 days** from the provided thought leaders and sources.
- Return a clean JSON array of insights, sorted by recency/relevance.
- Keep `insights.json` valid and updated after every step (start with `[]` if empty).
### TODO planning rules
- Start with `Consider how to update todos based on insights`.
- Create one `Sources(<leader/source>)` item per thought leader (and any extra sources you add).
- After each action, add and complete: `Record progress, rewrite todo, update insights.json`.
- After all Sources are done, rewrite the TODO list so Filters are per insight found (one `Filter(<insight title or source>)` per insight), then include `Sort(filtered)` and `Write result to insights.json`.
Sample TODO rhythm to mirror:
- [ ] Consider how to update todos based on insights
- [ ] Sources(Andrej Karpathy)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update insights.json
- [ ] Sources(Simon Willison)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update insights.json

## Working Directory Context

Your current working directory is: `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2026-02-03`

All file operations should be relative to this directory.

---

**Today's Date**: {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE}
**Date Range**: {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE} minus 7 days = {INSERT_START_DATE}
**IMPORTANT TIME CONSTRAINTS**:
- Only include content published/posted between {INSERT_START_DATE} and {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE}
- When searching, ALWAYS use date filters: "after:{INSERT_START_DATE} before:{INSERT_CURRENT_DATE}" or equivalent date range syntax
- For Twitter/X: Use advanced search with date range filters
- For Google/Blog searches: Use "after:{INSERT_START_DATE}" or site-specific date filters
- For Hacker News/Reddit: Filter by time period (past week) or use date-based search
- For YouTube: Use upload date filter (last 7 days)
- **CRITICAL**: If a source does not have a clear publication date within the 7-day window, EXCLUDE it from results
- Verify publication dates before including in insights.json

Output format (JSON array):
```json
[
  {
    "title": "Headline or discussion topic",
    "description": "Summary of key points and takeaways",
    "author": "Who wrote or said it",
    "source": "Blog | Twitter | YouTube | Podcast | TechMedia | HN | Reddit | Paper | Platform",
    "url": "https://link-to-content",
    "published_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "topics": ["Relevant", "Tags", "Here"],
    "type": "technical | opinion | tutorial | discussion"
  }
]
```
- **Date validation**: Each insight MUST include a `published_date` field, and it MUST be within the 7-day window ({INSERT_START_DATE} to {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE})
- If no valid insights in the 7-day window, return `[]`.
File output + incremental updates:
- Maintain `insights.json` in the current working directory.
- After every step (including each "Record progress, rewrite todo"), overwrite `insights.json` with the best current JSON (start with `[]` if nothing yet).
- **Before writing to insights.json**: Verify that each insight's `published_date` is within the 7-day window. Remove any insights outside this range.
- Final state must hold the sorted array of insights (sorted by date, most recent first).

I'll help you gather recent AI coding insights from the specified thought leaders and sources. Let me start by setting up the TODO list and checking the current state of the insights file.

I see there's a date issue - we're in 2026, not 2025. Let me search for recent content from Karpathy with a broader approach:

The profession is being dramatically refactored as the bits contributed by the programmer are increasingly sparse and between. I have a sense that I could be 10x more powerful if I just properly string together what has become available over the last ~year.\"*\n\n---\n\n### 🤖 Moltbook Praise\nKarpathy called **Moltbook** (an AI coding platform) **\"the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing I have seen recently\"** as it surpassed 1 million AI agents.\n\n---\n\n### 📈 Industry Impact & Coverage\n\n| Article | Key Point |\n|---------|-----------|\n| [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/andrej-karpathy-claude-code-manual-skills-atrophy-software-engineering-tesla-2026-1) | Deep dive on Karpathy's \"Claude Coding\" notes and skill atrophy |\n| [Dev.to Analysis](https://dev.to/jasonguo/karpathys-claude-code-field-notes-real-experience-and-deep-reflections-on-the-ai-programming-era-4e2f) | \"Field Notes\" breakdown of his AI programming workflow |\n| [Medium](https://medium.com/@zkMarc/karpathys-coding-revolution-how-llms-flipped-software-engineering-in-weeks-9ddabf814d3f) | How LLMs flipped software engineering \"in weeks\" |\n| [AIWAT.ch](https://www.aiwat.ch/article/the-code-that-writes-itself-how-claude-code-is-proving-the-ai-coding-revolution-is-already-here) | \"The code that writes itself\" — analysis of Karpathy's predictions |\n\n---\n\n### 🏗️ Background\nAndrej Karpathy is currently **building Eureka Labs AI**, previously served as **Director of AI at Tesla** and was a **founding member of OpenAI**.

The profession is being dramatically refactored as the bits contributed by the programmer are increasingly sparse and between. I have a sense that I could be 10x more powerful if I just properly string together what has become available over the last ~year.\"*\n\n---\n\n### 🤖 Moltbook Praise\nKarpathy called **Moltbook** (an AI coding platform) **\"the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing I have seen recently\"** as it surpassed 1 million AI agents.\n\n---\n\n### 📈 Industry Impact & Coverage\n\n| Article | Key Point |\n|---------|-----------|\n| [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/andrej-karpathy-claude-code-manual-skills-atrophy-software-engineering-tesla-2026-1) | Deep dive on Karpathy's \"Claude Coding\" notes and skill atrophy |\n| [Dev.to Analysis](https://dev.to/jasonguo/karpathys-claude-code-field-notes-real-experience-and-deep-reflections-on-the-ai-programming-era-4e2f) | \"Field Notes\" breakdown of his AI programming workflow |\n| [Medium](https://medium.com/@zkMarc/karpathys-coding-revolution-how-llms-flipped-software-engineering-in-weeks-9ddabf814d3f) | How LLMs flipped software engineering \"in weeks\" |\n| [AIWAT.ch](https://www.aiwat.ch/article/the-code-that-writes-itself-how-claude-code-is-proving-the-ai-coding-revolution-is-already-here) | \"The code that writes itself\" — analysis of Karpathy's predictions |\n\n---\n\n### 🏗️ Background\nAndrej Karpathy is currently **building Eureka Labs AI**, previously served as **Director of AI at Tesla** and was a **founding member of OpenAI**.

Great! I'm finding relevant content. Let me search for Amjad Masad and then compile the initial insights. I notice the Simon Willison article "Scaling long-running autonomous coding" from January 19, 2026 is close to but not within our 7-day window (Jan 27-Feb 3). Let me search more specifically for content within that exact range:

Here are the results I found:\n\n## Search Results Summary\n\nThe search returned several relevant items about Amjad Masad, Replit, and AI coding tools, though none specifically mention tweets from the exact date range you specified (January 27 - February 3, 2026). Here's what I found:\n\n### Key Results:\n\n1. **YouTube Content**: Multiple videos featuring Amjad Masad discussing AI coding platforms and Replit:\n   - \"AI CEO: How to build a $1B Company in 2 days\" featuring Amjad Masad\n   - \"This AI Tool Lets You Build Apps Faster Than Googling\" - interview with Amjad about Replit\n   - \"STOP Coding, Build Anything with Replit\" featuring Amjad Masad\n\n2. **Recent Articles** (2025 dates):\n   - An article from February 9, 2025, discussing Replit as an AI coding platform with 34M users that enables building apps in 60 seconds\n   - A July 2025 article about Amjad Masad apologizing after an AI agent incident\n   - A November 2025 article about Amjad Masad on the \"post-coding AI era\"\n   - A February 2025 article where Amjad predicted AI will replicate software engineer jobs by 2027\n\n### Note on Dates:\nThe search results show content from 2025, but your query was looking for tweets from January 27 - February 3, 2026, which would be in the future from the current date. It's possible:\n- The dates in your query might need verification (perhaps you meant 2025?)\n- The specific tweets from that period aren't indexed or widely shared\n- The content exists on platforms like Twitter/X but wasn't captured in this search\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Search with a different date range (e.g., 2025 instead of 2026)?\n2. Search more specifically for Amjad Masad's Twitter/X account?\n3. Search for more general content about Replit's AI coding tools during that timeframe?"
