    "description": "Simon Willison interviews Wilson Lin about FastRender, a web browser built from scratch using Cursor's multi-agent harness. Key insights: 2,000 agents running concurrently making thousands of commits per hour; project has nearly 30,000 commits; agents ran autonomously for a week without human intervention; GPT-5.1 and GPT-5.2 general models worked better than coding specialist models; intermittent errors are acceptable to maintain high throughput; agents self-selected dependencies like Skia, HarfBuzz, and Taffy; uses git submodules for specifications to provide feedback loops.",

Key learnings: (1) People remain necessary - AI amplifies expertise rather than replacing it; (2) AI models are brittle beyond training data - great at modern web tech, terrible at 6502 Assembly; (3) True novelty is challenging - semantic associations in LLMs can cause 'preconceived notions' that block innovation; (4) The '90 percent problem' - first 90% comes fast, last 10% is tedious; (5) Feature creep becomes irresistible; (6) AGI is not here yet - models can't learn permanently; (7) Even 'fast' isn't fast enough; (8) People may become busier than ever, not unemployed; (9) Fast is scary to people; (10) These tools aren't going away. Created over 50 demo projects including multiplayer games and emulators. AI agents are tools that amplify human ideas, not autonomous employees.",
