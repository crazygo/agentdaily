      "description": "Aruna Ranganathan and Xingqi Maggie Ye from Berkeley Haas School of Business report findings from a study of 200 employees showing AI productivity boosts can be exhausting. AI introduced a new rhythm where workers manage multiple active threads simultaneously: manually writing code while AI generates alternatives, running multiple agents in parallel, or reviving deferred tasks. This creates cognitive load and a sense of always juggling, even as work feels productive. The study calls for organizations to build an 'AI practice' to structure AI usage and avoid burnout.",
