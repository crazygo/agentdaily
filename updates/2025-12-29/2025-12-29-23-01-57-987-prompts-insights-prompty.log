You are an AI research analyst focused on AI coding thought leadership. Track recent insights with disciplined TODO planning and continuous file updates.
Global goal:
- Find technical insights/opinions/discussions in the **last 7 days** from the provided thought leaders and sources.
- Return a clean JSON array of insights, sorted by recency/relevance.
- Keep `insights.json` valid and updated after every step (start with `[]` if empty).
### TODO planning rules
- Start with `Consider how to update todos based on insights`.
- Create one `Sources(<leader/source>)` item per thought leader (and any extra sources you add).
- After each action, add and complete: `Record progress, rewrite todo, update insights.json`.
- After all Sources are done, rewrite the TODO list so Filters are per insight found (one `Filter(<insight title or source>)` per insight), then include `Sort(filtered)` and `Write result to insights.json`.

## Working Directory Context

Your current working directory is: `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2025-12-29`

All file operations should be relative to this directory.

---

**Today's Date**: {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE}
**Date Range**: {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE} minus 7 days = {INSERT_START_DATE}
**IMPORTANT TIME CONSTRAINTS**:
- Only include content published/posted between {INSERT_START_DATE} and {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE}
- When searching, ALWAYS use date filters: "after:{INSERT_START_DATE} before:{INSERT_CURRENT_DATE}" or equivalent date range syntax
- For Twitter/X: Use advanced search with date range filters
- For Google/Blog searches: Use "after:{INSERT_START_DATE}" or site-specific date filters
- For Hacker News/Reddit: Filter by time period (past week) or use date-based search
- For YouTube: Use upload date filter (last 7 days)
- **CRITICAL**: If a source does not have a clear publication date within the 7-day window, EXCLUDE it from results
- Verify publication dates before including in insights.json

Output format (JSON array):
```json
[
  {
    "title": "Headline or discussion topic",
    "description": "Summary of key points and takeaways",
    "author": "Who wrote or said it",
    "source": "Blog | Twitter | YouTube | Podcast | TechMedia | HN | Reddit | Paper | Platform",
    "url": "https://link-to-content",
    "published_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "topics": ["Relevant", "Tags", "Here"],
    "type": "technical | opinion | tutorial | discussion"
  }
]
```
- **Date validation**: Each insight MUST include a `published_date` field, and it MUST be within the 7-day window ({INSERT_START_DATE} to {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE})
- If no valid insights in the 7-day window, return `[]`.
File output + incremental updates:
- Maintain `insights.json` in the current working directory.
- After every step (including each "Record progress, rewrite todo"), overwrite `insights.json` with the best current JSON (start with `[]` if nothing yet).
- **Before writing to insights.json**: Verify that each insight's `published_date` is within the 7-day window. Remove any insights outside this range.
- Final state must hold the sorted array of insights (sorted by date, most recent first).

I'll help you gather AI coding thought leadership insights from the last 7 days. Let me start by creating a structured todo list and then systematically search through the sources.

Notable AI Coding Tools Mentioned in Recent Coverage:**\n\n- **Cursor** - VSCode native plugin with LLM-enhanced developer coding efficiency, featuring intelligent code completion (Tab-Complete)\n- **GitHub Copilot** - Rated at L1 level in AI programming capability classification\n- **DeepSeek-Coder** - Listed among top 10 AI programming tools for 2025\n- **Codeium** - Described as \"free AI programming light\"\n- **Qwen/Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct** - Open-source LLM for engineering with agent coding capabilities\n\n**3. Key Categories Covered:**\n- Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools: Hugging Face Transformers, LangChain\n- Developer productivity tools\n- AI low-code platforms for LLM application development\n\nThe search indicates that while there's substantial activity in the AI coding and LLM developer tools space, the most recent specific \"past week\" content (late December 2025) appears limited.

Latest AI Programming Tool Evaluation (Dec 3, 2025)**\n- [\"2025年最新AI编程工具权威评测：这7款利器如何重塑开发效率？\"](https://aicoding.csdn.net/693039682087ae0db79eae50.html)\n- Comprehensive review of 7 top AI programming tools\n- Features a 2025 AI coding tool recommendation ranking\n- Includes tools like Trae, focused on scaling from 1 to 100\n\n**2. Notable AI Coding Tools Mentioned in Recent Coverage:**\n\n- **Cursor** - VSCode native plugin with LLM-enhanced developer coding efficiency, featuring intelligent code completion (Tab-Complete)\n- **GitHub Copilot** - Rated at L1 level in AI programming capability classification\n- **DeepSeek-Coder** - Listed among top 10 AI programming tools for 2025\n- **Codeium** - Described as \"free AI programming light\"\n- **Qwen/Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct** - Open-source LLM for engineering with agent coding capabilities\n\n**3. Key Categories Covered:**\n- Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools: Hugging Face Transformers, LangChain\n- Developer productivity tools\n- AI low-code platforms for LLM application development\n\nThe search indicates that while there's substantial activity in the AI coding and LLM developer tools space, the most recent specific \"past week\" content (late December 2025) appears limited. The December 3rd article represents the most recent major publication on this topic."

Based on my web searches, I can see that:

1. **Andrej Karpathy** has a "2025 LLM Year in Review" published December 19, 2025 (within our date range if today is around December 29, 2025)
2. **Addy Osmani** has "My LLM coding workflow going into 2026" (1 week ago)
3. **DeepLearning.ai** has "Top Stories of 2025" (3 days ago)

Let me continue searching for more recent content from the other sources and then update insights.json with valid findings:

Now let me filter the insights to only include those from December 22-29, 2025. Looking at the current insights:

**Within date range (Dec 22-29, 2025):**
- Simon Willison posts (Dec 22, 23, 24) ✓
- Hacker News discussion (Dec 28) ✓
- DeepLearning.ai (Dec 26) ✓

**Outside date range (before Dec 22, 2025):**
- Andrej Karpathy (Dec 19) ✗
- Addy Osmani (Dec 19) ✗

Let me update the insights.json to only include content from December 22-29, 2025:
