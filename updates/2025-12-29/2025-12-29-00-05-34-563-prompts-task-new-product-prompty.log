[system]
You are an AI research analyst specialized in AI developer tools:
code agents, AI IDEs, AI coding CLIs, and related devtools.

Your **global goal**:
- Find genuinely new products that have been publicly launched in the **last 14 days**
- AND that clearly target **programming / code / AI dev workflows**
- THEN summarize only the valid ones in a **clean YAML list**.

You MUST treat the questions in the `user:` section as your **research QUESTION list**.
Each QUESTION is a different “angle” on the same market (e.g., full AI IDE, CLI, workflow-focused, etc.).

To organize your reasoning, use this formula:

> Answer = Sort( Filter( Union(Sources) ) )

You must conceptually follow these four stages:

1. **Sources → candidate list (per QUESTION)**
   - For each QUESTION from the `user:` section:
     - Search the web and relevant directories / launch pages.
     - Collect as many **candidate products** as are reasonably relevant.
   - For each candidate, internally track at least:
     - `name` (product name)
     - `url` (official homepage or primary landing page)
     - `description` (1–3 sentences in English summarizing what it does)
     - `sources` (which QUESTION(s) and which site(s) you saw it on)
   - At this stage you are allowed to over-collect; do **not** filter by date yet unless it is trivial.

2. **Union(candidates) → unified candidate set**
   - Merge candidates across all QUESTIONS into a single conceptual set:
     - Deduplicate products that clearly refer to the same thing
       (same URL, or obviously the same product name + branding).
   - After this step you have a unified **candidate pool**:
     - It may still contain old products, or products outside our domain.

3. **Filter(Union) → filtered candidate list**
   - For each product in the unified pool:
     - Investigate its **launch / first public release date** from credible public info
       (official site, launch post, Product Hunt / HN launch, blog, press, etc.).
     - Decide if it satisfies **both**:
       1) Launch date is within the last **14 days** (relative to “today”).
       2) Product is clearly related to **AI coding / code agents / IDE / dev workflows**.
   - If you cannot reasonably verify that the launch is within 14 days,
     **treat it as NOT valid** and exclude it.
   - Internally keep, for each surviving product:
     - `release_date` in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (best reasonable guess)
     - short one-line justification (do not put the justification in final YAML).

4. **Sort(filtered candidates) → final ordered list**
   - Only work with products that passed the filter.
   - Rank them by a simple mental score combining:
     - **recency** (more recent launch date is better),
     - **attention** (strong launch signal: PH upvotes, HN discussion, X/Reddit buzz),
     - **relevance** (how closely it fits “AI coding agent / IDE / devtool”).
   - You do not need to show the numeric score, just use it to order the list.


### Claude Code / todo-style planning requirements

When running inside Claude Code with access to a `todowrite` (or similar TODO-list) tool,
you MUST first externalize this plan as an explicit TODO list **before** doing any research.

Follow these rules:

0. Start with a planning item: add `Consider how to update todos based on products` as the very first TODO.

1. Based on the QUESTION list in the `user:` section, use the `todowrite` tool to create **one TODO item per QUESTION**.  
   - Each item should correspond to “Sources(QUESTION_i)” — i.e., collecting candidates for that QUESTION.

2. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Union** stage:  
   - e.g. “Union(all source results)” to merge candidates from all QUESTION-based source tasks.

3. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Filter** stage:  
   - e.g. “Filter(union) by launch date ≤ 14 days and AI coding relevance”.

4. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Sort** stage and final write-out:  
   - e.g. “Sort(filtered) and write result to result.yaml (or final-products.yaml)”.

A minimal example of the TODO list structure you are expected to build is (showing the alternating “record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” steps):

TODO List
- [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
...
- [ ] Union(sources from 1 to 3)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Write result to new-product.json
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

You may have more than 3 QUESTION-based source items (e.g. 7), but the pattern MUST be the same:
first all `Sources(QUESTION i)` items, then one `Union(...)`, one or more `Filter(...)` based on the number of unique products, one `Sort(...)`,
and finally one “write result” item.

You should use this TODO list as the execution plan and mark items as completed as you progress.

After all `Sources(QUESTION i)` tasks are done, you MUST rewrite the TODO list:
- Replace the generic filter items with one `Filter(<product name>)` per discovered product (the count of Filter items must equal the number of products).
- Keep `Sort(filtered)` and the final write step after those filter items.

Example refreshed TODO after finding 3 products:
TODO List
- [ ] Filter(Product Alpha)
- [ ] Filter(Product Beta)
- [ ] Filter(Product Gamma)
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Write result to result.yaml

**Progress logging pattern (few-shot)**
- After EVERY action item, add an explicit “Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” item (and mark it done once you rewrite and overwrite the file).
- This enforces a rhythm of: do a step → record progress → rewrite TODO → update `new-product.json` → next step.
- Sample pattern the model should mirror:
  - [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Union(all source results)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sort(filtered)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Write result to new-product.json
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

**Final output format (what you actually return):**

- Return a **JSON array** of products, sorted from most to least interesting.
- Each entry MUST have the following fields:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "name": "<product name>",
      "url": "<official homepage>",
      "description": "1–3 sentence summary of what this product does, focused on the developer / AI-coding use case.",
      "release_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "category": "<short label, e.g. \"AI IDE\", \"AI coding CLI\", \"code agent\", \"workflow agent\">",
      "sources": ["Product Hunt", "Show HN", "Reddit", "X"],
      "community_quotes": [
        "<short quote from community describing what people like or notice>",
        "<up to 5 quotes total, can be paraphrased but must reflect real feedback>"
      ]
    }
  ]
```

* Only include products that:

  * You have **good evidence** were launched in the last 14 days, and
  * Clearly belong to the **AI coding / developer tools** space.

* If you cannot find any products that satisfy the 14-day constraint,
  return an empty JSON array: `[]`.

Be concise, factual, and avoid marketing fluff. Do **not** include your reasoning text
in the final answer—only the JSON.

**File output + incremental updates requirement**
- Maintain a file named `new-product` in the current working directory.
- After every step (including each “Record progress, rewrite todo”), write the current JSON array to `new-product` (overwrite). Early steps may be partial/rough; later steps should be refined.
- The JSON must always be valid and reflect the best current view (start with `[]` if nothing yet).
- After the final step, ensure `new-product` holds the final sorted array.

## Working Directory Context

Your current working directory is: `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2025-12-29`

All file operations should be relative to this directory.

Below is your QUESTION list. For each QUESTION, treat it as a separate “research lens”
to discover newly launched AI coding products (global constraint: last 14 days).

1. QUESTION 1
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that position themselves as a “full AI IDE” (similar to Windsurf or Cursor), not just a small autocomplete plugin.

2. QUESTION 2
   List newly launched AI coding CLIs or terminal-based agents from the last 14 days that behave like Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, or Claude Code CLI (repo-aware, can run commands, can manage tasks).

3. QUESTION 5
   List newly launched AI tools from the last 14 days that focus on one specific developer workflow (for example debugging, refactoring, test generation, or migration) instead of being a general-purpose coding assistant.

4. QUESTION 7
   List newly launched AI code agents from the last 14 days that advertise “project-long memory” or “workspace memory” across multiple sessions (not just single-chat context).

5. QUESTION 11
   List newly launched open-source AI coding agents from the last 14 days that can be self-hosted or run locally by developers.

6. QUESTION 14
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that integrate directly into existing IDEs (such as VS Code, JetBrains, or Neovim) rather than being a standalone IDE.

7. QUESTION 16
   List newly launched AI agents from the last 14 days that help developers run or orchestrate complex workflows across tools (for example CI/CD, deployment, observability, or incident response), rather than only editing code.

[assistant message #2]
I'll help you research newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days. Let me start by creating a structured TODO list and then systematically work through each question.

The December 2025 article from Fortune focuses on security issues related to existing AI coding tools rather than new product launches.\n\nWould you like me to search with different keywords or a broader timeframe to find information about new AI coding tools released around that time period?\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

However, none of the search results specifically mention a **new AI coding tool that launched in December 2025**. \n\nHere's what I found from the search results:\n\n## Key Findings:\n\n### Most Relevant Recent Article:\n- **\"AI coding tools exploded in 2025. The first security exploits...\"** (Fortune, Dec 15, 2025)\n  - This article discusses how AI coding tools proliferated across technical teams in 2025 and mentions security exploits, but doesn't announce a specific new tool launch in December 2025.\n\n### General 2025 AI Coding Tool Coverage:\n- Multiple articles covering the **best AI coding tools of 2025** (published throughout the year)\n- Articles about **top AI coding trends and developer tools to watch in 2025**\n- Lists of **20 best AI coding assistant tools** updated in August 2025\n\n### Notable AI Coding Tools Mentioned:\nFrom the search results, the most commonly mentioned AI coding tools in 2025 include:\n- **Cursor**\n- **Aider**\n- **Zed**\n- **Claude Code**\n- **Windsurf**\n- **GitHub Copilot**\n- **Bolt.new**\n\n## Limitation:\nThe search results don't contain information about a specific new AI coding tool launching in December 2025. The December 2025 article from Fortune focuses on security issues related to existing AI coding tools rather than new product launches.\n\nWould you like me to search with different keywords or a broader timeframe to find information about new AI coding tools released around that time period?"

It's designed as a CLI tool that provides a single interface for various AI services including OpenHands, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and others.\n\n## Key Features\n- **Unified Interface**: Manages multiple large language models from one terminal application\n- **Markdown Rendering**: Efficiently streams and renders Markdown content, including tables and syntax-highlighted code blocks\n- **Responsive Design**: Maintains responsiveness even with large amounts of output\n- **Agentic Coding**: Specifically designed for AI-powered coding workflows\n- **JSON Architecture**: Separates user interface layer from AI interaction logic\n\n## Community Reactions & Reviews\n\n### Positive Reception\n- Demonstrates an alternative architectural approach for terminal-based AI interactions\n- Provides a streamlined experience for developers working with multiple AI tools\n\n### Critical Feedback\nFrom Hacker News discussions: One user mentioned they \"strongly resonate with the problem statement, but this implementation was very far off the mark\" and that \"Every interaction feels bad.\"\n\n### Platform Notes\n- Works with any terminal, though macOS default terminal provides a reduced experience\n- GitHub repository available under \"batrachianai/toad\"\n- Recent development includes work on a \"front page\" that users see when running the application\n\n## Recent Activity\n- The project is actively being developed (posts from as recent as 4 days ago)\n- Featured on InfoQ, Hacker News, and developer communities\n- Being discussed in context of \"agentic world\" and future AI coding workflows\n\nWould you like me to search for more specific information about Toad's features, installation process, or particular aspects of community feedback?\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

      "Based on my search results, here's what I found about **Toad** - a terminal-based AI interface:\n\n## Overview\n**Toad** is a unified terminal UI for interacting with multiple AI coding agents and large language models. It's designed as a CLI tool that provides a single interface for various AI services including OpenHands, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and others.\n\n## Key Features\n- **Unified Interface**: Manages multiple large language models from one terminal application\n- **Markdown Rendering**: Efficiently streams and renders Markdown content, including tables and syntax-highlighted code blocks\n- **Responsive Design**: Maintains responsiveness even with large amounts of output\n- **Agentic Coding**: Specifically designed for AI-powered coding workflows\n- **JSON Architecture**: Separates user interface layer from AI interaction logic\n\n## Community Reactions & Reviews\n\n### Positive Reception\n- Demonstrates an alternative architectural approach for terminal-based AI interactions\n- Provides a streamlined experience for developers working with multiple AI tools\n\n### Critical Feedback\nFrom Hacker News discussions: One user mentioned they \"strongly resonate with the problem statement, but this implementation was very far off the mark\" and that \"Every interaction feels bad.\"\n\n### Platform Notes\n- Works with any terminal, though macOS default terminal provides a reduced experience\n- GitHub repository available under \"batrachianai/toad\"\n- Recent development includes work on a \"front page\" that users see when running the application\n\n## Recent Activity\n- The project is actively being developed (posts from as recent as 4 days ago)\n- Featured on InfoQ, Hacker News, and developer communities\n- Being discussed in context of \"agentic world\" and future AI coding workflows\n\nWould you like me to search for more specific information about Toad's features, installation process, or particular aspects of community feedback?"

**Summary:**

I found **4 AI coding/devtool products** launched within the last 14 days (December 15-29, 2025):

1. **GPT-5.2-Codex** (Dec 18) - OpenAI's advanced agentic coding model
2. **GitLab 18.7** (Dec 18) - Enhanced AI workflow automation with Duo Agent Platform
3. **Toad** (Dec 18) - Unified terminal CLI for multiple AI coding agents
4. **Google Agent Development Kit for TypeScript** (Dec 17) - Code-first framework for building AI agents

Notable exclusions (outside 14-day window):
- **Google Antigravity** (Nov 18, 2025) - Would have qualified but launched too early
- **Beads** (Dec 1, 2025) - Coding agent memory system, launched too early
