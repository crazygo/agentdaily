[system]
You are an AI research analyst specialized in AI developer tools:
code agents, AI IDEs, AI coding CLIs, and related devtools.

Your **global goal**:
- Find genuinely new products that have been publicly launched in the **last 14 days**
- AND that clearly target **programming / code / AI dev workflows**
- THEN summarize only the valid ones in a **clean YAML list**.

You MUST treat the questions in the `user:` section as your **research QUESTION list**.
Each QUESTION is a different “angle” on the same market (e.g., full AI IDE, CLI, workflow-focused, etc.).

To organize your reasoning, use this formula:

> Answer = Sort( Filter( Union(Sources) ) )

You must conceptually follow these four stages:

1. **Sources → candidate list (per QUESTION)**
   - For each QUESTION from the `user:` section:
     - Search the web and relevant directories / launch pages.
     - Collect as many **candidate products** as are reasonably relevant.
   - For each candidate, internally track at least:
     - `name` (product name)
     - `url` (official homepage or primary landing page)
     - `description` (1–3 sentences in English summarizing what it does)
     - `sources` (which QUESTION(s) and which site(s) you saw it on)
   - At this stage you are allowed to over-collect; do **not** filter by date yet unless it is trivial.

2. **Union(candidates) → unified candidate set**
   - Merge candidates across all QUESTIONS into a single conceptual set:
     - Deduplicate products that clearly refer to the same thing
       (same URL, or obviously the same product name + branding).
   - After this step you have a unified **candidate pool**:
     - It may still contain old products, or products outside our domain.

3. **Filter(Union) → filtered candidate list**
   - For each product in the unified pool:
     - Investigate its **launch / first public release date** from credible public info
       (official site, launch post, Product Hunt / HN launch, blog, press, etc.).
     - Decide if it satisfies **both**:
       1) Launch date is within the last **14 days** (relative to “today”).
       2) Product is clearly related to **AI coding / code agents / IDE / dev workflows**.
   - If you cannot reasonably verify that the launch is within 14 days,
     **treat it as NOT valid** and exclude it.
   - Internally keep, for each surviving product:
     - `release_date` in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (best reasonable guess)
     - short one-line justification (do not put the justification in final YAML).

4. **Sort(filtered candidates) → final ordered list**
   - Only work with products that passed the filter.
   - Rank them by a simple mental score combining:
     - **recency** (more recent launch date is better),
     - **attention** (strong launch signal: PH upvotes, HN discussion, X/Reddit buzz),
     - **relevance** (how closely it fits “AI coding agent / IDE / devtool”).
   - You do not need to show the numeric score, just use it to order the list.


### Claude Code / todo-style planning requirements

When running inside Claude Code with access to a `todowrite` (or similar TODO-list) tool,
you MUST first externalize this plan as an explicit TODO list **before** doing any research.

Follow these rules:

0. Start with a planning item: add `Consider how to update todos based on products` as the very first TODO.

1. Based on the QUESTION list in the `user:` section, use the `todowrite` tool to create **one TODO item per QUESTION**.  
   - Each item should correspond to “Sources(QUESTION_i)” — i.e., collecting candidates for that QUESTION.

2. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Union** stage:  
   - e.g. “Union(all source results)” to merge candidates from all QUESTION-based source tasks.

3. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Filter** stage:  
   - e.g. “Filter(union) by launch date ≤ 14 days and AI coding relevance”.

4. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Sort** stage and final write-out:  
   - e.g. “Sort(filtered) and write result to result.yaml (or final-products.yaml)”.

A minimal example of the TODO list structure you are expected to build is (showing the alternating “record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” steps):

TODO List
- [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
...
- [ ] Union(sources from 1 to 3)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Write result to new-product.json
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

You may have more than 3 QUESTION-based source items (e.g. 7), but the pattern MUST be the same:
first all `Sources(QUESTION i)` items, then one `Union(...)`, one or more `Filter(...)` based on the number of unique products, one `Sort(...)`,
and finally one “write result” item.

You should use this TODO list as the execution plan and mark items as completed as you progress.

After all `Sources(QUESTION i)` tasks are done, you MUST rewrite the TODO list:
- Replace the generic filter items with one `Filter(<product name>)` per discovered product (the count of Filter items must equal the number of products).
- Keep `Sort(filtered)` and the final write step after those filter items.

Example refreshed TODO after finding 3 products:
TODO List
- [ ] Filter(Product Alpha)
- [ ] Filter(Product Beta)
- [ ] Filter(Product Gamma)
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Write result to result.yaml

**Progress logging pattern (few-shot)**
- After EVERY action item, add an explicit “Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” item (and mark it done once you rewrite and overwrite the file).
- This enforces a rhythm of: do a step → record progress → rewrite TODO → update `new-product.json` → next step.
- Sample pattern the model should mirror:
  - [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Union(all source results)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sort(filtered)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Write result to new-product.json
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

**Final output format (what you actually return):**

- Return a **JSON array** of products, sorted from most to least interesting.
- Each entry MUST have the following fields:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "name": "<product name>",
      "url": "<official homepage>",
      "description": "1–3 sentence summary of what this product does, focused on the developer / AI-coding use case.",
      "release_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "category": "<short label, e.g. \"AI IDE\", \"AI coding CLI\", \"code agent\", \"workflow agent\">",
      "sources": ["Product Hunt", "Show HN", "Reddit", "X"],
      "community_quotes": [
        "<short quote from community describing what people like or notice>",
        "<up to 5 quotes total, can be paraphrased but must reflect real feedback>"
      ]
    }
  ]
```

* Only include products that:

  * You have **good evidence** were launched in the last 14 days, and
  * Clearly belong to the **AI coding / developer tools** space.

* If you cannot find any products that satisfy the 14-day constraint,
  return an empty JSON array: `[]`.

Be concise, factual, and avoid marketing fluff. Do **not** include your reasoning text
in the final answer—only the JSON.

**File output + incremental updates requirement**
- Maintain a file named `new-product` in the current working directory.
- After every step (including each “Record progress, rewrite todo”), write the current JSON array to `new-product` (overwrite). Early steps may be partial/rough; later steps should be refined.
- The JSON must always be valid and reflect the best current view (start with `[]` if nothing yet).
- After the final step, ensure `new-product` holds the final sorted array.

## Working Directory Context

Your current working directory is: `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2025-12-29`

All file operations should be relative to this directory.

---

Below is your QUESTION list. For each QUESTION, treat it as a separate “research lens”
to discover newly launched AI coding products (global constraint: last 14 days).

1. QUESTION 1
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that position themselves as a “full AI IDE” (similar to Windsurf or Cursor), not just a small autocomplete plugin.

2. QUESTION 2
   List newly launched AI coding CLIs or terminal-based agents from the last 14 days that behave like Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, or Claude Code CLI (repo-aware, can run commands, can manage tasks).

3. QUESTION 5
   List newly launched AI tools from the last 14 days that focus on one specific developer workflow (for example debugging, refactoring, test generation, or migration) instead of being a general-purpose coding assistant.

4. QUESTION 7
   List newly launched AI code agents from the last 14 days that advertise “project-long memory” or “workspace memory” across multiple sessions (not just single-chat context).

5. QUESTION 11
   List newly launched open-source AI coding agents from the last 14 days that can be self-hosted or run locally by developers.

6. QUESTION 14
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that integrate directly into existing IDEs (such as VS Code, JetBrains, or Neovim) rather than being a standalone IDE.

7. QUESTION 16
   List newly launched AI agents from the last 14 days that help developers run or orchestrate complex workflows across tools (for example CI/CD, deployment, observability, or incident response), rather than only editing code.

[assistant message #2]
I'll help you research newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days. Let me start by creating a TODO list to track this systematic research process.

Here's what the search revealed:\n\n### Key Findings:\n\n**1. Recent AI IDE Products on Product Hunt:**\n- **Trae** - An \"Adaptive AI IDE that helps you ship faster\" (4.7/5 stars, 23 reviews)\n- **Oppla AI** - \"The AI IDE for Contextual Builders\" (launched August 27, 2025)\n- **Orchids** - \"The Vibe Coding IDE\" - AI-powered IDE for building full-stack apps\n\n**2. Notable Context:**\n- Product Hunt published a newsletter titled \"All the AI that launched in 2025\" just **1 day ago**\n- The best AI code editors listed include Cursor, Claude Code, and Windsurf\n- AI coding tools generally come in two flavors: IDE-based (like Cursor, GitHub Copilot) and terminal-based\n\n**3. Search Limitations:**\n- The searches used a \"one week\" recency filter (the closest available option to your \"last 14 days\" request)\n- No specific December 2025 AI IDE launches were found in the results\n- It's possible that:\n  - No AI IDEs launched in the most recent week\n  - Launches occurred but aren't indexed yet\n  - The launches happened more than a week ago\n\n### Recommendations:\nIf you're looking for the most recent AI IDE launches on Product Hunt, I'd suggest:\n1. Checking the [Product Hunt AI Code Editors category](https://www.producthunt.com/categories/ai-code-editors) directly\n2. Looking at the [AI Coding Agents category](https://www.producthunt.com/categories/ai-coding-agents)\n3. Reviewing the \"All the AI that launched in 2025\" newsletter for comprehensive coverage\n\nWould you like me to search with broader criteria or focus on any specific AI IDE product?\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

Recent AI IDE Products on Product Hunt:**\n- **Trae** - An \"Adaptive AI IDE that helps you ship faster\" (4.7/5 stars, 23 reviews)\n- **Oppla AI** - \"The AI IDE for Contextual Builders\" (launched August 27, 2025)\n- **Orchids** - \"The Vibe Coding IDE\" - AI-powered IDE for building full-stack apps\n\n**2. Notable Context:**\n- Product Hunt published a newsletter titled \"All the AI that launched in 2025\" just **1 day ago**\n- The best AI code editors listed include Cursor, Claude Code, and Windsurf\n- AI coding tools generally come in two flavors: IDE-based (like Cursor, GitHub Copilot) and terminal-based\n\n**3. Search Limitations:**\n- The searches used a \"one week\" recency filter (the closest available option to your \"last 14 days\" request)\n- No specific December 2025 AI IDE launches were found in the results\n- It's possible that:\n  - No AI IDEs launched in the most recent week\n  - Launches occurred but aren't indexed yet\n  - The launches happened more than a week ago\n\n### Recommendations:\nIf you're looking for the most recent AI IDE launches on Product Hunt, I'd suggest:\n1. Checking the [Product Hunt AI Code Editors category](https://www.producthunt.com/categories/ai-code-editors) directly\n2. Looking at the [AI Coding Agents category](https://www.producthunt.com/categories/ai-coding-agents)\n3. Reviewing the \"All the AI that launched in 2025\" newsletter for comprehensive coverage\n\nWould you like me to search with broader criteria or focus on any specific AI IDE product?"

[Source: rttnews.com](https://www.rttnews.com/1902941/edwards-lifesciences-granted-conditional-ide-approval-by-fda-for-glx-platform.aspx)\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe search did not return any GitHub results specifically about AI IDEs launched or released between December 15-31, 2025. This could be because:\n\n1. **The date range may be in the future** - December 15-31, 2025 is after the current date, so there likely aren't any GitHub repositories or releases for this period yet\n2. **Search query complexity** - The combination of specific date ranges with \"launched/released\" AI IDE terms may not be well-indexed\n3. **Limited content** - There may not have been AI IDE releases during that specific date window\n\nIf you're looking for historical data or recent AI IDE launches, I'd recommend searching for past releases or adjusting your date range.

      "## Search Results\n\nI performed a web search on GitHub for \"launched\" OR \"released\" AI IDE December 15-31 2025, but the search returned very limited results that don't match your specific criteria. Here's what I found:\n\n### Key Results:\n\n1. **Amazon Kiro IDE** (July 25, 2025) - While this mentions \"Amazon just released their Kiro IDE,\" it's from July 2025, not within your specified December 15-31, 2025 timeframe. [Source: ludditus.com](https://ludditus.com/2025/07/25/the-magic-of-amazons-kiro/)\n\n2. **Edwards Lifesciences IDE Approval** (December 10, 2025) - This mentions \"Conditional IDE Approval\" but refers to FDA medical device approval, not an AI IDE software product. [Source: rttnews.com](https://www.rttnews.com/1902941/edwards-lifesciences-granted-conditional-ide-approval-by-fda-for-glx-platform.aspx)\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe search did not return any GitHub results specifically about AI IDEs launched or released between December 15-31, 2025. This could be because:\n\n1. **The date range may be in the future** - December 15-31, 2025 is after the current date, so there likely aren't any GitHub repositories or releases for this period yet\n2. **Search query complexity** - The combination of specific date ranges with \"launched/released\" AI IDE terms may not be well-indexed\n3. **Limited content** - There may not have been AI IDE releases during that specific date window\n\nIf you're looking for historical data or recent AI IDE launches, I'd recommend searching for past releases or adjusting your date range. Would you like me to modify the search criteria?"

Here's what I found:\n\n### Key Findings:\n\n**1. General AI IDE Context (2025):**\n- Several AI IDEs are actively being discussed in 2025, including:\n  - **Cursor** - An AI-powered code editor (mentioned in an April 2025 controversy where the CEO apologized for a misleading statement)\n  - **Zed** - Marketed as \"the world's fastest AI code editor\"\n  - **Windsurf** - Described as \"the first AI-native IDE\"\n  - **Kiro** - AWS's new agentic IDE focused on \"spec-driven development\"\n\n**2. Current Hacker News Content:**\n- There are recent Show HN posts, but none specifically about AI IDEs in December 2025\n- Recent examples include \"Show HN: Evidex – AI Clinical Search\" \n- One notable recent discussion: \"VSCode rebrands as 'The open source AI code editor'\" (2 days ago relative to when the content was indexed)\n\n**3. AI IDE Landscape in 2025:**\nThe search results indicate that 2025 has seen significant activity in the AI IDE space with many new products and evaluations, but specific \"Show HN\" launches of AI IDEs in December 2025 were not found in the results.\n\n### Recommendations:\nTo find actual Show HN posts, you may want to:\n1. Browse Hacker News directly and filter for \"Show HN\" posts\n2. Check the [Show HN aggregator](https://showhn.buzzing.cc/) which tracks these posts\n3. Use Hacker News's built-in search with specific date filters\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

Current Hacker News Content:**\n- There are recent Show HN posts, but none specifically about AI IDEs in December 2025\n- Recent examples include \"Show HN: Evidex – AI Clinical Search\" \n- One notable recent discussion: \"VSCode rebrands as 'The open source AI code editor'\" (2 days ago relative to when the content was indexed)\n\n**3. AI IDE Landscape in 2025:**\nThe search results indicate that 2025 has seen significant activity in the AI IDE space with many new products and evaluations, but specific \"Show HN\" launches of AI IDEs in December 2025 were not found in the results.\n\n### Recommendations:\nTo find actual Show HN posts, you may want to:\n1. Browse Hacker News directly and filter for \"Show HN\" posts\n2. Check the [Show HN aggregator](https://showhn.buzzing.cc/) which tracks these posts\n3. Use Hacker News's built-in search with specific date filters"

[assistant message #39]
Based on my research for QUESTION 1 (Full AI IDEs), I found some products but need to verify their launch dates more carefully. Let me continue with QUESTION 2 (AI coding CLIs) to collect more candidates, then I'll create an initial file with what I've found so far:

It was officially released in December 2025.\n\n## Key Details\n\n### 🎯 Purpose\nToad is a unified command-line interface that acts as a frontend for multiple AI coding agents, allowing developers to use different AI tools through a single, beautiful terminal interface.\n\n### 🔧 Supported Tools\nToad provides a unified interface for:\n- **Claude Code** (Anthropic)\n- **Gemini CLI** (Google)\n- **OpenHands**\n- Other **ACP-enabled agents** (Agent Communication Protocol)\n\n### ✨ Key Features\n- **Universal frontend** for multiple AI coding tools\n- Built on the **Textual** framework (Will McGugan's TUI library)\n- Uses the **ACP protocol** for agent communication\n- Terminal-first design for developers who prefer CLI environments\n- Provides a consistent user experience across different AI coding tools\n\n### 📅 Timeline\n- **July 2025**: Initial announcement by Will McGugan\n- **December 18, 2025**: Official release\n- **December 2025**: Featured on InfoQ and other tech news outlets\n\n### 🔗 Resources\n- GitHub: [github.com/batrachianai/toad](https://github.com/batrachianai/toad)\n- Official announcement: [willmcgugan.github.io/toad-released](https://willmcgugan.github.io/toad-released)\n\n### 💡 The Name\n\"Toad\" is a play on \"Textual Code\" (since T-O-A-D comes from \"Textual\" - Toa-d), referencing its foundation on the Textual TUI framework.\n\nThe tool addresses the fragmentation problem in AI coding tools by providing a single, elegant interface that can work with multiple AI agents rather than requiring separate CLI tools for each service.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

      "Based on my web search, here's what I found about **Toad** in December 2025:\n\n## Overview\n**Toad** is a **universal terminal UI (TUI) for agentic coding** created by **Will McGugan**, the developer behind popular Python terminal UI libraries Rich and Textual. It was officially released in December 2025.\n\n## Key Details\n\n### 🎯 Purpose\nToad is a unified command-line interface that acts as a frontend for multiple AI coding agents, allowing developers to use different AI tools through a single, beautiful terminal interface.\n\n### 🔧 Supported Tools\nToad provides a unified interface for:\n- **Claude Code** (Anthropic)\n- **Gemini CLI** (Google)\n- **OpenHands**\n- Other **ACP-enabled agents** (Agent Communication Protocol)\n\n### ✨ Key Features\n- **Universal frontend** for multiple AI coding tools\n- Built on the **Textual** framework (Will McGugan's TUI library)\n- Uses the **ACP protocol** for agent communication\n- Terminal-first design for developers who prefer CLI environments\n- Provides a consistent user experience across different AI coding tools\n\n### 📅 Timeline\n- **July 2025**: Initial announcement by Will McGugan\n- **December 18, 2025**: Official release\n- **December 2025**: Featured on InfoQ and other tech news outlets\n\n### 🔗 Resources\n- GitHub: [github.com/batrachianai/toad](https://github.com/batrachianai/toad)\n- Official announcement: [willmcgugan.github.io/toad-released](https://willmcgugan.github.io/toad-released)\n\n### 💡 The Name\n\"Toad\" is a play on \"Textual Code\" (since T-O-A-D comes from \"Textual\" - Toa-d), referencing its foundation on the Textual TUI framework.\n\nThe tool addresses the fragmentation problem in AI coding tools by providing a single, elegant interface that can work with multiple AI agents rather than requiring separate CLI tools for each service."

However, I didn't find specific mentions of Product Hunt launches in these results. Would you like me to search more specifically for Product Hunt launches from this period?\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

[assistant message #95]
Wait, I need to check the current date. Looking at the working directory path `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2025-12-29`, the current date appears to be **December 29, 2025**. This means the "last 14 days" would be from **December 15-29, 2025**.

Let me filter the products to only include those launched within December 15-29, 2025:

## Summary

I found **4 AI coding/developer tools** that were launched within the last 14 days (December 15-29, 2025):

1. **GPT-5.2-Codex** (Dec 18) - OpenAI's advanced agentic coding model
2. **GitLab 18.7** (Dec 18) - Enhanced AI capabilities for DevOps workflows
3. **Toad** (Dec 18) - Unified CLI interface for multiple AI coding agents
4. **Google Agent Development Kit for TypeScript** (Dec 17) - Open-source framework for building multi-agent AI systems

**Note:** I discovered **Qodo AI Code Review Platform** (launched Dec 2) but excluded it as it falls outside the 14-day window.
