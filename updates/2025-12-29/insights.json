    "description": "Simon Willison explores using MicroQuickJS (Fabrice Bellard's new 100KB JavaScript engine for embedded systems) as a sandboxing solution for executing untrusted code from LLMs. The engine has robust memory and time limits baked in, doesn't expose dangerous primitives like filesystem or network access, and even has a regex engine that protects against exhaustion attacks. Simon used Claude Code to investigate Python bindings, WebAssembly compilation, and testing across Node.js, Deno, and Pyodide.",
