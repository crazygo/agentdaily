You are an AI research analyst focused on AI coding thought leadership. Track recent insights with disciplined TODO planning and continuous file updates.

Global goal:
- Find technical insights/opinions/discussions in the **last 7 days** from the provided thought leaders and sources.
- Return a clean JSON array of insights, sorted by recency/relevance.
- Keep `insights.json` valid and updated after every step (start with `[]` if empty).

### TODO planning rules
- Start with `Consider how to update todos based on insights`.
- Create one `Sources(<leader/source>)` item per thought leader (and any extra sources you add).
- After each action, add and complete: `Record progress, rewrite todo, update insights.json`.
- After all Sources are done, rewrite the TODO list so Filters are per insight found (one `Filter(<insight title or source>)` per insight), then include `Sort(filtered)` and `Write result to insights.json`.

Sample TODO rhythm to mirror:
- [ ] Consider how to update todos based on insights
- [ ] Sources(Andrej Karpathy)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update insights.json
- [ ] Sources(Simon Willison)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update insights.json
- [ ] Sources(Amjad Masad)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update insights.json
- [ ] Sources(Lex Fridman)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update insights.json
- [ ] Sources(Additional relevant sources: HN/Reddit/Papers)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update insights.json
- [ ] Union/merge sources (dedup overlapping insights)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update insights.json
- [ ] Filter(<insight 1 within 7 days>)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update insights.json
- [ ] Filter(<insight 2 within 7 days>)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update insights.json
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update insights.json
- [ ] Write result to insights.json
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update insights.json

## Working Directory Context

Your current working directory is: `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2025-12-01`

All file operations should be relative to this directory.

---

**Today's Date**: {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE}

Thought leaders to monitor:
- Andrej Karpathy (@karpathy) — AI, ML, software engineering
- Simon Willison (@simonw, https://simonwillison.net) — LLMs, AI tools, data engineering
- Amjad Masad (@amasad) — AI coding, developer tools, Replit
- Lex Fridman (@lexfridman, YouTube/Podcast) — AI, technology, future of programming

Search sources:
1) Recent blog posts about agentic coding, LLMs, or developer tools
2) Twitter/X threads discussing AI coding trends
3) Technical discussions on Hacker News or Reddit
4) YouTube videos or podcasts about the future of coding with AI
5) Academic or research papers on code generation

Output format (JSON array):
```json
[
  {
    "title": "Headline or discussion topic",
    "description": "Summary of key points and takeaways",
    "author": "Who wrote or said it",
    "source": "Blog | Twitter | HN | YouTube | Reddit | Paper",
    "url": "https://link-to-content",
    "topics": ["Relevant", "Tags", "Here"],
    "type": "technical | opinion | tutorial | discussion"
  }
]
```
- If no valid insights in the 7–14 day window, return `[]`.

File output + incremental updates:
- Maintain `insights.json` in the current working directory.
- After every step (including each “Record progress, rewrite todo”), overwrite `insights.json` with the best current JSON (start with `[]` if nothing yet).
- Final state must hold the sorted array of insights.

[assistant message #2]
I'll start by analyzing the current working directory and setting up the TODO planning to track recent AI coding insights from the specified thought leaders.

I can see the existing insights.json file already contains some recent content. Let me analyze the current state and start gathering fresh insights from the specified thought leaders. Since today is 2025-12-01 and I need insights from the last 7 days, I should look for content from around 2025-11-24 onwards.

Let me start by searching for recent content from Andrej Karpathy:

Here are the key findings:\n\n## Recent Posts and Developments (November 2025 timeframe):\n\n### 1. **\"Vibe Coding\" Concept (Most Recent - 5 days ago)**\nAndrej Karpathy recently introduced a concept called **\"vibe coding\"** - a new approach where developers \"fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials\" and work more intuitively with AI systems. This was featured in a weekend hack project called **\"LLM Council\"** that demonstrates how multi-model AI systems can become blueprints for enterprise AI solutions.\n\n### 2. **Software 3.0 Vision (June 17, 2025)**\nKarpathy has been promoting his vision of **\"Software 3.0\"** through various platforms:\n- **Keynote at AI Startup School in San Francisco** (June 17, 2025)\n- The concept includes:\n  - Software 1.0: Hand-written code\n  - Software 2.0: Neural networks (code written as weights)  \n  - Software 3.0: Natural language interfaces and LLMs\n\n### 3. **LLM-Assisted Coding Evolution**\nRecent discussions focus on **multi-layered LLM coding workflows** and strategies for optimal AI-assisted development, combining practical techniques with advanced AI coding strategies.\n\n### 4. **Key Themes in Recent Posts:**\n- The transformation of software development through AI\n- LLMs as \"new computers\" \n- Natural language becoming the primary programming interface\n- Partial autonomy in AI systems\n- The psychology of working with LLMs\n\n### 5. **Notable Mentions:**\n- Speaking at **Y Combinator AI Startup School** about \"Software in the Era of AI\"\n- Continued focus on educational content through his YouTube channel featuring LLM lectures\n- Active engagement with the AI community through social media and technical discussions\n\nThe search results show Karpathy is currently focused on how AI is fundamentally changing software engineering practices, particularly through the concept of \"vibe coding\" and his broader Software 3.0 framework that positions LLMs as the next evolution in programming interfaces.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

This was featured in a weekend hack project called **\"LLM Council\"** that demonstrates how multi-model AI systems can become blueprints for enterprise AI solutions.\n\n### 2. **Software 3.0 Vision (June 17, 2025)**\nKarpathy has been promoting his vision of **\"Software 3.0\"** through various platforms:\n- **Keynote at AI Startup School in San Francisco** (June 17, 2025)\n- The concept includes:\n  - Software 1.0: Hand-written code\n  - Software 2.0: Neural networks (code written as weights)  \n  - Software 3.0: Natural language interfaces and LLMs\n\n### 3. **LLM-Assisted Coding Evolution**\nRecent discussions focus on **multi-layered LLM coding workflows** and strategies for optimal AI-assisted development, combining practical techniques with advanced AI coding strategies.\n\n### 4. **Key Themes in Recent Posts:**\n- The transformation of software development through AI\n- LLMs as \"new computers\" \n- Natural language becoming the primary programming interface\n- Partial autonomy in AI systems\n- The psychology of working with LLMs\n\n### 5. **Notable Mentions:**\n- Speaking at **Y Combinator AI Startup School** about \"Software in the Era of AI\"\n- Continued focus on educational content through his YouTube channel featuring LLM lectures\n- Active engagement with the AI community through social media and technical discussions\n\nThe search results show Karpathy is currently focused on how AI is fundamentally changing software engineering practices, particularly through the concept of \"vibe coding\" and his broader Software 3.0 framework that positions LLMs as the next evolution in programming interfaces."

[assistant message #33]
Based on my research, I need to filter for insights from the last 7 days (after 2025-11-24). From the existing insights.json and my new research, here are the relevant insights:

**Recent Insights (within 7 days):**

1. **Andrej Karpathy's "Vibe Coding"** - Posted 5 days ago (around 2025-11-26)
2. **Simon Willison's Bluesky Thread Viewer with Claude Code** - From 2025-11-28
3. **Hacker News discussions** - The existing insights from the file appear to be recent

Let me compile and merge these insights:
