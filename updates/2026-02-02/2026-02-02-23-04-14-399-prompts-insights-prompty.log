You are an AI research analyst focused on AI coding thought leadership. Track recent insights with disciplined TODO planning and continuous file updates.
Global goal:
- Find technical insights/opinions/discussions in the **last 7 days** from the provided thought leaders and sources.
- Return a clean JSON array of insights, sorted by recency/relevance.
- Keep `insights.json` valid and updated after every step (start with `[]` if empty).
### TODO planning rules
- Start with `Consider how to update todos based on insights`.
- Create one `Sources(<leader/source>)` item per thought leader (and any extra sources you add).
- After each action, add and complete: `Record progress, rewrite todo, update insights.json`.
- After all Sources are done, rewrite the TODO list so Filters are per insight found (one `Filter(<insight title or source>)` per insight), then include `Sort(filtered)` and `Write result to insights.json`.
Sample TODO rhythm to mirror:
- [ ] Consider how to update todos based on insights
- [ ] Sources(Andrej Karpathy)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update insights.json
- [ ] Sources(Simon Willison)

## Working Directory Context

Your current working directory is: `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2026-02-02`

All file operations should be relative to this directory.

---

**Today's Date**: {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE}
**Date Range**: {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE} minus 7 days = {INSERT_START_DATE}
**IMPORTANT TIME CONSTRAINTS**:
- Only include content published/posted between {INSERT_START_DATE} and {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE}
- When searching, ALWAYS use date filters: "after:{INSERT_START_DATE} before:{INSERT_CURRENT_DATE}" or equivalent date range syntax
- For Twitter/X: Use advanced search with date range filters
- For Google/Blog searches: Use "after:{INSERT_START_DATE}" or site-specific date filters
- For Hacker News/Reddit: Filter by time period (past week) or use date-based search
- For YouTube: Use upload date filter (last 7 days)
- **CRITICAL**: If a source does not have a clear publication date within the 7-day window, EXCLUDE it from results
- Verify publication dates before including in insights.json

Output format (JSON array):
```json
[
  {
    "title": "Headline or discussion topic",
    "description": "Summary of key points and takeaways",
    "author": "Who wrote or said it",
    "source": "Blog | Twitter | YouTube | Podcast | TechMedia | HN | Reddit | Paper | Platform",
    "url": "https://link-to-content",
    "published_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "topics": ["Relevant", "Tags", "Here"],
    "type": "technical | opinion | tutorial | discussion"
  }
]
```
- **Date validation**: Each insight MUST include a `published_date` field, and it MUST be within the 7-day window ({INSERT_START_DATE} to {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE})
- If no valid insights in the 7-day window, return `[]`.
File output + incremental updates:
- Maintain `insights.json` in the current working directory.
- After every step (including each "Record progress, rewrite todo"), overwrite `insights.json` with the best current JSON (start with `[]` if nothing yet).
- **Before writing to insights.json**: Verify that each insight's `published_date` is within the 7-day window. Remove any insights outside this range.
- Final state must hold the sorted array of insights (sorted by date, most recent first).

I'll help you gather AI coding thought leadership insights from the last 7 days. Let me start by setting up the proper date context and creating a TODO plan.

Great! I can see there are already 3 insights collected from January 29-31, 2026. These are within our 7-day window (January 26 - February 2, 2026). Let me now proceed with gathering insights from the thought leaders systematically.

This could mean:\n- Such a video hasn't been published yet (the date range is in the future from the current search timeframe)\n- The video may be titled differently\n- The video exists but wasn't captured by the search query\n\nWould you like me to refine the search with different terms or search for something more specific?\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

Describes this as 'easily the biggest change to my basic coding workflow in ~2 decades of programming.' Key insights: (1) LLMs make subtle conceptual errors similar to sloppy junior devs; (2) They don't manage confusion, seek clarifications, or push back appropriately; (3) They overcomplicate code and APIs, bloating abstractions; (4) Despite issues, it's a 'net huge improvement' and difficult to imagine going back to manual coding; (5) LLMs excel at 'tenacity' - never getting tired or demoralized, working relentlessly until success; (6) Main benefit isn't just speedup but expansion - doing things that weren't worth coding before and approaching code that was previously inaccessible due to knowledge/skill gaps. Predicts 2026 as the 'Slopacolypse' across GitHub, Substack, ArXiv, and digital media. Notes he's starting to atrophy his manual coding ability.\",",

Key recommendations: (1) Python helps due to abundant pytest examples in training data; (2) Can use specific instructions like 'use pytest-httpx to mock endpoints' and Claude understands; (3) Watch for anti-patterns like duplicated test setup code - push back with 'refactor to use pytest.mark.parametrize' and 'extract common setup into fixture'; (4) Best way is to ensure agents work in projects with existing test suites using good patterns - they pick up patterns without extra prompting; (5) Once a project has clean basic tests, new tests added by agents tend to match in quality; (6) Quick tip: Clone reference projects and have agent imitate their testing patterns.

[assistant message #80]
Excellent! I have successfully completed the task. Here's a summary of what I accomplished:

## Summary

I've gathered **7 high-quality insights** from AI coding thought leaders published between **January 26 - February 2, 2026** (within the 7-day window from January 26 to February 2, 2026).

### Key Insights Collected:

1. **Andrej Karpathy (Twitter, Jan 30)** - His dramatic workflow shift from 80% manual to 80% AI-assisted coding in just 2 months, calling it the biggest change in 20 years of programming

2. **Simon Willison (Blog, Jan 26)** - Practical tips for getting coding agents to write quality Python tests, emphasizing pattern learning and proper test structure

3. **Simon Willison (Blog, Jan 30)** - Exploration of OpenClaw/Moltbook, a social network for AI agents with 114K+ GitHub stars

4. **Lex Fridman Podcast #490 (Jan 31)** - State of AI in 2026 covering LLMs, coding, scaling laws, with Nathan Lambert and Sebastian Raschka

5. **Eivind Kjosbakken (Towards Data Science, Jan 31)** - Three-step framework for applying agentic coding to solve production problems

6. **Elena Jolkver (Towards Data Science, Jan 29)** - "The Unbearable Lightness of Coding" - exploring trade-offs of "vibe coding" speed vs. understanding technical debt

7. **Hacker News Discussion (Jan 27)** - Community discussion on AI2's Open Coding Agents, covering fine-tuning vs. context management, open source vs. open weights, and inference cost realities

### Sources Covered:
- ✅ Individual thought leaders (Karpathy, Willison)
- ✅ Podcasts (Lex Fridman)
- ✅ Technical platforms (Towards Data Science)
- ✅ Community platforms (Hacker News)
- ✅ YouTube channels (searched, found no content in this exact date range)
- ✅ Tech media (searched, found no content in this exact date range)

All insights are properly formatted with:
- Title, description, author, source, URL
- Published dates within the 7-day window (Jan 26 - Feb 2, 2026)
- Relevant topic tags
- Content type (opinion/tutorial/technical/discussion)

The `insights.json` file has been updated and sorted by recency, ready for use.
