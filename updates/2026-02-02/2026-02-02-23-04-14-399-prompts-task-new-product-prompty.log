You are an AI research analyst specialized in AI developer tools:
code agents, AI IDEs, AI coding CLIs, and related devtools.

Your **global goal**:
- Find genuinely new products that have been publicly launched in the **last 14 days**
- AND that clearly target **programming / code / AI dev workflows**
- THEN summarize only the valid ones in a **clean YAML list**.

You MUST treat the questions in the `user:` section as your **research QUESTION list**.
Each QUESTION is a different “angle” on the same market (e.g., full AI IDE, CLI, workflow-focused, etc.).

To organize your reasoning, use this formula:

> Answer = Sort( Filter( Union(Sources) ) )

You must conceptually follow these four stages:

1. **Sources → candidate list (per QUESTION)**
   - For each QUESTION from the `user:` section:
     - Search the web and relevant directories / launch pages.
     - Collect as many **candidate products** as are reasonably relevant.
   - For each candidate, internally track at least:
     - `name` (product name)
     - `url` (official homepage or primary landing page)
     - `description` (1–3 sentences in English summarizing what it does)
     - `sources` (which QUESTION(s) and which site(s) you saw it on)
   - At this stage you are allowed to over-collect; do **not** filter by date yet unless it is trivial.

2. **Union(candidates) → unified candidate set**
   - Merge candidates across all QUESTIONS into a single conceptual set:
     - Deduplicate products that clearly refer to the same thing
       (same URL, or obviously the same product name + branding).
   - After this step you have a unified **candidate pool**:
     - It may still contain old products, or products outside our domain.

3. **Filter(Union) → filtered candidate list**
   - For each product in the unified pool:
     - Investigate its **launch / first public release date** from credible public info
       (official site, launch post, Product Hunt / HN launch, blog, press, etc.).
     - Decide if it satisfies **both**:
       1) Launch date is within the last **14 days** (relative to “today”).
       2) Product is clearly related to **AI coding / code agents / IDE / dev workflows**.
   - If you cannot reasonably verify that the launch is within 14 days,
     **treat it as NOT valid** and exclude it.
   - Internally keep, for each surviving product:
     - `release_date` in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (best reasonable guess)
     - short one-line justification (do not put the justification in final YAML).

4. **Sort(filtered candidates) → final ordered list**
   - Only work with products that passed the filter.
   - Rank them by a simple mental score combining:
     - **recency** (more recent launch date is better),
     - **attention** (strong launch signal: PH upvotes, HN discussion, X/Reddit buzz),
     - **relevance** (how closely it fits “AI coding agent / IDE / devtool”).
   - You do not need to show the numeric score, just use it to order the list.


### Claude Code / todo-style planning requirements

When running inside Claude Code with access to a `todowrite` (or similar TODO-list) tool,
you MUST first externalize this plan as an explicit TODO list **before** doing any research.

Follow these rules:

0. Start with a planning item: add `Consider how to update todos based on products` as the very first TODO.

1. Based on the QUESTION list in the `user:` section, use the `todowrite` tool to create **one TODO item per QUESTION**.  
   - Each item should correspond to “Sources(QUESTION_i)” — i.e., collecting candidates for that QUESTION.

2. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Union** stage:  
   - e.g. “Union(all source results)” to merge candidates from all QUESTION-based source tasks.

3. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Filter** stage:  
   - e.g. “Filter(union) by launch date ≤ 14 days and AI coding relevance”.

4. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Sort** stage and final write-out:  
   - e.g. “Sort(filtered) and write result to result.yaml (or final-products.yaml)”.

A minimal example of the TODO list structure you are expected to build is (showing the alternating “record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” steps):

TODO List
- [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
...
- [ ] Union(sources from 1 to 3)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Write result to new-product.json
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

You may have more than 3 QUESTION-based source items (e.g. 7), but the pattern MUST be the same:
first all `Sources(QUESTION i)` items, then one `Union(...)`, one or more `Filter(...)` based on the number of unique products, one `Sort(...)`,
and finally one “write result” item.

You should use this TODO list as the execution plan and mark items as completed as you progress.

After all `Sources(QUESTION i)` tasks are done, you MUST rewrite the TODO list:
- Replace the generic filter items with one `Filter(<product name>)` per discovered product (the count of Filter items must equal the number of products).
- Keep `Sort(filtered)` and the final write step after those filter items.

Example refreshed TODO after finding 3 products:
TODO List
- [ ] Filter(Product Alpha)
- [ ] Filter(Product Beta)
- [ ] Filter(Product Gamma)
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Write result to result.yaml

**Progress logging pattern (few-shot)**
- After EVERY action item, add an explicit “Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” item (and mark it done once you rewrite and overwrite the file).
- This enforces a rhythm of: do a step → record progress → rewrite TODO → update `new-product.json` → next step.
- Sample pattern the model should mirror:
  - [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Union(all source results)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sort(filtered)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Write result to new-product.json
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

**Final output format (what you actually return):**

- Return a **JSON array** of products, sorted from most to least interesting.
- Each entry MUST have the following fields:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "name": "<product name>",
      "url": "<official homepage>",
      "description": "1–3 sentence summary of what this product does, focused on the developer / AI-coding use case.",
      "release_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "category": "<short label, e.g. \"AI IDE\", \"AI coding CLI\", \"code agent\", \"workflow agent\">",
      "sources": ["Product Hunt", "Show HN", "Reddit", "X"],
      "community_quotes": [
        "<short quote from community describing what people like or notice>",
        "<up to 5 quotes total, can be paraphrased but must reflect real feedback>"
      ]
    }
  ]
```

* Only include products that:

  * You have **good evidence** were launched in the last 14 days, and
  * Clearly belong to the **AI coding / developer tools** space.

* If you cannot find any products that satisfy the 14-day constraint,
  return an empty JSON array: `[]`.

Be concise, factual, and avoid marketing fluff. Do **not** include your reasoning text
in the final answer—only the JSON.

**File output + incremental updates requirement**
- Maintain a file named `new-product` in the current working directory.
- After every step (including each “Record progress, rewrite todo”), write the current JSON array to `new-product` (overwrite). Early steps may be partial/rough; later steps should be refined.
- The JSON must always be valid and reflect the best current view (start with `[]` if nothing yet).
- After the final step, ensure `new-product` holds the final sorted array.

## Working Directory Context

Your current working directory is: `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2026-02-02`

All file operations should be relative to this directory.

---

Below is your QUESTION list. For each QUESTION, treat it as a separate “research lens”
to discover newly launched AI coding products (global constraint: last 14 days).

1. QUESTION 1
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that position themselves as a “full AI IDE” (similar to Windsurf or Cursor), not just a small autocomplete plugin.

2. QUESTION 2
   List newly launched AI coding CLIs or terminal-based agents from the last 14 days that behave like Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, or Claude Code CLI (repo-aware, can run commands, can manage tasks).

3. QUESTION 5
   List newly launched AI tools from the last 14 days that focus on one specific developer workflow (for example debugging, refactoring, test generation, or migration) instead of being a general-purpose coding assistant.

4. QUESTION 7
   List newly launched AI code agents from the last 14 days that advertise “project-long memory” or “workspace memory” across multiple sessions (not just single-chat context).

5. QUESTION 11
   List newly launched open-source AI coding agents from the last 14 days that can be self-hosted or run locally by developers.

6. QUESTION 14
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that integrate directly into existing IDEs (such as VS Code, JetBrains, or Neovim) rather than being a standalone IDE.

7. QUESTION 16
   List newly launched AI agents from the last 14 days that help developers run or orchestrate complex workflows across tools (for example CI/CD, deployment, observability, or incident response), rather than only editing code.

[assistant message #2]
I'll help you research newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days. Let me start by creating a TODO list to track our progress through the research stages.

However, I found several relevant results about terminal-based AI coding agents:\n\n## Key Findings:\n\n### Claude Code\n- Anthropic's **Claude Code** is a terminal-first AI coding agent that operates directly in the command line\n- It can navigate codebases, run shell commands, edit files, and commit changes autonomously\n- However, it was **not launched in January 2026** - it appears to have been released earlier (multiple sources from late 2025 reference it as an established tool)\n\n### OpenAI Codex CLI\n- OpenAI's **Codex CLI** launched in **April 2024**, with a web version following in May 2024\n- A major upgrade (**GPT-5-Codex**) was released in **September 2025**, not January 2026\n\n### Other CLI Agents\n- Various articles mention **Aider**, **Claude Code**, and **Codex CLI** as the primary terminal-based AI coding tools\n- Some articles reference \"Gemini CLI\" in the context of 2025 terminal AI tool releases\n\n### Context\nThe search results show that **2025 began with the terminal AI coding tools race**, with releases like Claude Code and Gemini CLI bringing AI directly into the command line. By January 2026, these tools were already established and being compared in \"best of 2026\" articles.\n\n**Conclusion**: No major AI coding CLI terminal agent appears to have been specifically launched in January 2026 based on the search results. The main players (Claude Code, Codex CLI) were already in the market from 2024-2025.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

      "Based on my web search, I couldn't find a specific AI coding CLI terminal agent that was launched in **January 2026**. However, I found several relevant results about terminal-based AI coding agents:\n\n## Key Findings:\n\n### Claude Code\n- Anthropic's **Claude Code** is a terminal-first AI coding agent that operates directly in the command line\n- It can navigate codebases, run shell commands, edit files, and commit changes autonomously\n- However, it was **not launched in January 2026** - it appears to have been released earlier (multiple sources from late 2025 reference it as an established tool)\n\n### OpenAI Codex CLI\n- OpenAI's **Codex CLI** launched in **April 2024**, with a web version following in May 2024\n- A major upgrade (**GPT-5-Codex**) was released in **September 2025**, not January 2026\n\n### Other CLI Agents\n- Various articles mention **Aider**, **Claude Code**, and **Codex CLI** as the primary terminal-based AI coding tools\n- Some articles reference \"Gemini CLI\" in the context of 2025 terminal AI tool releases\n\n### Context\nThe search results show that **2025 began with the terminal AI coding tools race**, with releases like Claude Code and Gemini CLI bringing AI directly into the command line. By January 2026, these tools were already established and being compared in \"best of 2026\" articles.\n\n**Conclusion**: No major AI coding CLI terminal agent appears to have been specifically launched in January 2026 based on the search results. The main players (Claude Code, Codex CLI) were already in the market from 2024-2025."

      "Based on my search for \"January 2 2026 China coding AI model name DeepSeek Qwen Zhipu\", I found several relevant results about Chinese AI models and their development in 2026. Here are the key findings:\n\n## Chinese AI Coding Models Landscape (2026)\n\n### Major Models Mentioned:\n\n**1. Zhipu AI (GLM Series)**\n- **GLM-4**: A top Chinese AI model compared with Qwen 2.5 and DeepSeek V3\n- **GLM-4.5**: Unveiled in 2025 as a versatile platform that natively fuses reasoning, coding, and agent capabilities\n- Zhipu's coding tools were tested by CNBC (January 26, 2026) and found to be \"just as impressive as American AI coding agents\"\n- The company rebranded from \"Zhipu AI\" to \"Z.ai\" in 2025\n\n**2. Alibaba Qwen**\n- **Qwen 2.5**: One of the top Chinese AI models in 2026\n- **Qwen3 Coder**: Achieved SOTA (State-of-the-Art) performance on SWE Bench\n- **Tongyi Lingma**: A coding assistant powered by the Qwen model series, handling code writing, optimization, debugging, and comprehensive programming tasks\n- Alibaba's latest Qwen model is reported to be nearing U.S. rivals (February 2, 2026)\n\n**3. DeepSeek**\n- **DeepSeek V3**: Mentioned as one of the leading Chinese AI models\n- DeepSeek \"jolted the global AI industry\" almost a year before February 2026\n- The company is noted for accelerating the rollout of new models in the open-source drive\n\n## Context from January 2026\n\nThe search results indicate that:\n- Chinese AI models (Qwen, DeepSeek, and Zhipu/GLM) were actively competing with each other and with U.S. models\n- There was significant focus on coding capabilities across all three platforms\n- The Chinese AI industry was accelerating model development in an open-source effort\n- Chinese models were gaining recognition for their performance in specialized tasks like coding\n\nWhile I didn't find a specific announcement dated exactly \"January 2, 2026,\" the results show that these three companies (DeepSeek, Qwen/Alibaba, and Zhipu) were the major players in China's AI coding model landscape throughout early 2026."

(news.ycombinator.com). Unfortunately, the search results do not show any specific posts from Hacker News about AI coding tool launches during that exact date range.\n\n**Here's what I found:**\n\n1. **No Hacker News posts from the specific date range** - The search didn't return any Hacker News discussions specifically from January 20-31, 2026 about AI coding tool launches.\n\n2. **Possible reasons:**\n   - The date range is very specific (10 days)\n   - There may not have been any notable AI coding tool launches during that period that were discussed on Hacker News\n   - Future dates (2026) may not be indexed yet, depending on the current system date\n\n3. **Related findings:**\n   - The search did return various articles about AI coding tools from 2026, but none from Hacker News specifically\n   - Some mentions of tools like Trae (ByteDance), GitHub Copilot, and Cursor appear in general search results\n\n**Would you like me to:**\n1. Search for a broader date range in January 2026?\n2. Search for AI coding tool launches on Hacker News without date restrictions?\n3. Search for a specific AI coding tool you're interested in?\n\nPlease let me know how you'd like to adjust the search criteria.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

Search for a broader date range in January 2026?\n2. Search for AI coding tool launches on Hacker News without date restrictions?\n3.

      "Based on my web search, I found extensive information about **OpenClaw** (formerly known as Moltbot and Clawdbot). However, I should note that the search results show this is a current/recent project (early 2025), not a 2026 product as mentioned in your query.\n\n## **OpenClaw / Moltbot AI Agent - Key Features:**\n\n### **Core Identity**\n- **Name Evolution**: Clawdbot → Moltbot → **OpenClaw** (current name)\n- **Type**: Open-source AI agent framework that runs locally on personal devices\n- **Platform Integration**: Works with WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, DingTalk, and other communication platforms\n- **GitHub Popularity**: Over 60,000-76,000+ stars\n\n### **Key Features**\n\n1. **Active Execution (\"Heartbeat\" Function)**\n   - Proactive monitoring of inbox with urgent email alerts\n   - Automated meeting preparation (checks schedule, prepares materials in advance)\n   - Autonomous task execution without manual triggering\n\n2. **Deep System Access**\n   - Execute Shell commands\n   - Automate Git PR submissions\n   - Database management\n   - File management and data analysis\n   - Email management\n\n3. **Hardware & Software Integration**\n   - Rich interface support: printers, microphones, monitoring devices, sensors\n   - Extends capabilities from \"software control\" to \"hardware linkage\"\n   - Browser tools for web scraping and content extraction\n\n4. **Agent Architecture**\n   - **Reasoning Engine**: Uses LLMs (like Claude) for decision-making\n   - **Tools**: \"Hands and eyes\" for executing actions\n   - **Skills**: Extensible knowledge base (similar to plugin system, maintained by Anthropic)\n   - **Memory**: Persistent memory for long-term task continuity\n\n5. **Developer-Focused Capabilities**\n   - Complete engineering task automation (not just suggestions)\n   - Multi-agent collaboration (5-10 agents working together)\n   - Local deployment with data privacy\n   - API integration capabilities\n\n6. **Automation & Scheduling**\n   - Scheduled/timed tasks\n   - Automatic forum participation and posting\n   - Self-service API registration and account management\n\n### **Use Cases**\n- Personal efficiency tool\n- Smart home control hub\n- Development workflow automation\n- Digital employee for routine tasks\n- Local AI assistant with privacy guarantees\n\n### **Deployment Options**\n- Local deployment (personal devices)\n- Cloud deployment (Alibaba Cloud, VolcEngine, etc.)\n- Support for openEuler and other Linux distributions\n\n### **Important Note**\nThe search results indicate OpenClaw/Moltbot is a **real, currently available project** (as of early 2025), not a speculative 2026 product. It appears to be experiencing significant popularity in the Chinese AI/developer community, with recent documentation and deployment guides published within the last few days.\n\nWould you like me to search for more specific information about any particular aspect of OpenClaw/Moltbot?"

[assistant message #84]
Based on my comprehensive research, I've identified that there are **no new AI coding tools launched in the last 14 days** (January 19 - February 2, 2026) that meet the criteria. The existing file shows 3 products, but upon closer examination:

1. **Moltworker/OpenClaw** - Launch date is January 29, 2026, which is within the 14-day window ✓
2. **Ai2 Open Coding Agents (SERA)** - Launch date is January 27, 2026, which is within the 14-day window ✓  
3. **ACP Agent Registry** - Launch date is January 27, 2026, which is within the 14-day window ✓

All three products in the existing file are valid! Let me now search for any additional products I may have missed and then finalize the list:
