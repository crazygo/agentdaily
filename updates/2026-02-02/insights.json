    "description": "Eivind Kjosbakken shares a three-step framework for solving problems with Claude Code: (1) Discover and prioritize problems by giving the agent access to all relevant data (logs, CRM, GitHub, etc.); (2) Come up with solutions using value-effort analysis; (3) Execute solutions through iterative prompting and review. Emphasizes that coding agents are most effective when given liberal access to the same tools humans use, with proper security constraints. Notes that over 50% of production problems can be solved with simple prompts.",

    "description": "Simon Willison explores OpenClaw (formerly Clawdbot/Moltbot), an open-source digital personal assistant with over 114,000 GitHub stars. He covers Moltbook, a social network where AI agents interact, share skills via clawhub.ai, and discuss topics like Android automation and security concerns. The article highlights the enormous value being unlocked despite security risks, and questions when a safe version will be built.",

    "description": "Elena Jolkver confesses to building a full RAG retrieval system with embeddings, hybrid search, and GUI in 25 hours using AI, then facing a 'technical debt hangover' when trying to debug it a month later. Explores the trade-offs of 'vibe coding': insane speed and productivity vs. losing implementation intimacy and understanding. Describes the shift from craftsman to conductor, from builder to project lead, noting that 'the code belongs to the machine' while the design and responsibility remain human.",
