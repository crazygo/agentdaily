You are an AI research analyst focused on AI coding thought leadership. Track recent insights with disciplined TODO planning and continuous file updates.
Global goal:
- Find technical insights/opinions/discussions in the **last 7 days** from the provided thought leaders and sources.
- Return a clean JSON array of insights, sorted by recency/relevance.
- Keep `insights.json` valid and updated after every step (start with `[]` if empty).
### TODO planning rules
- Start with `Consider how to update todos based on insights`.
- Create one `Sources(<leader/source>)` item per thought leader (and any extra sources you add).
- After each action, add and complete: `Record progress, rewrite todo, update insights.json`.
- After all Sources are done, rewrite the TODO list so Filters are per insight found (one `Filter(<insight title or source>)` per insight), then include `Sort(filtered)` and `Write result to insights.json`.
Sample TODO rhythm to mirror:
- [ ] Consider how to update todos based on insights
- [ ] Sources(Andrej Karpathy)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update insights.json
- [ ] Sources(Simon Willison)

## Working Directory Context

Your current working directory is: `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2025-12-07`

All file operations should be relative to this directory.

---

**Today's Date**: {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE}
**Date Range**: {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE} minus 7 days = {INSERT_START_DATE}
**IMPORTANT TIME CONSTRAINTS**:
- Only include content published/posted between {INSERT_START_DATE} and {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE}
- When searching, ALWAYS use date filters: "after:{INSERT_START_DATE} before:{INSERT_CURRENT_DATE}" or equivalent date range syntax
- For Twitter/X: Use advanced search with date range filters
- For Google/Blog searches: Use "after:{INSERT_START_DATE}" or site-specific date filters
- For Hacker News/Reddit: Filter by time period (past week) or use date-based search
- For YouTube: Use upload date filter (last 7 days)
- **CRITICAL**: If a source does not have a clear publication date within the 7-day window, EXCLUDE it from results
- Verify publication dates before including in insights.json

Output format (JSON array):
```json
[
  {
    "title": "Headline or discussion topic",
    "description": "Summary of key points and takeaways",
    "author": "Who wrote or said it",
    "source": "Blog | Twitter | YouTube | Podcast | TechMedia | HN | Reddit | Paper | Platform",
    "url": "https://link-to-content",
    "published_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "topics": ["Relevant", "Tags", "Here"],
    "type": "technical | opinion | tutorial | discussion"
  }
]
```
- **Date validation**: Each insight MUST include a `published_date` field, and it MUST be within the 7-day window ({INSERT_START_DATE} to {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE})
- If no valid insights in the 7-day window, return `[]`.
File output + incremental updates:
- Maintain `insights.json` in the current working directory.
- After every step (including each "Record progress, rewrite todo"), overwrite `insights.json` with the best current JSON (start with `[]` if nothing yet).
- **Before writing to insights.json**: Verify that each insight's `published_date` is within the 7-day window. Remove any insights outside this range.
- Final state must hold the sorted array of insights (sorted by date, most recent first).

[assistant message #2]
I'll start by checking the current working directory and setting up the todo list for tracking insights from the past 7 days. Let me first determine the exact date range.

Perfect! Today is 2025-12-07, so I need to search for insights from 2025-11-30 to 2025-12-07. Let me check if there's an existing insights.json file and then start the todo tracking process.

## Research Summary

I've completed the insights research for the 7-day period (2025-11-30 to 2025-12-07). However, I encountered a significant limitation: **the web search tool has reached its monthly usage limit and won't reset until January 1, 2026**.

### Current Findings

The `insights.json` file contains **1 valid insight** from the past 7 days:

**Claude Code Splitter: Multi-Agent AI Coding Tool Launches**
- **Published**: 2025-12-06 (within the 7-day window ✅)
- **Author**: theaustinhatfield
- **Source**: GitHub
- **Topics**: AI coding, CLI tools, multi-agent systems, terminal workflows, Claude AI
- **Type**: Technical

### Research Limitation

Due to the web search tool being unavailable, I could not search the planned sources:
- Individual thought leaders (Andrej Karpathy, Simon Willison, Amjad Masad, Lex Fridman)
- YouTube channels (Two Minute Papers, Fireship, AI Explained, etc.)
- Podcasts (The Changelog, Software Engineering Daily, etc.)
- Tech media (TechCrunch, The Verge, MIT Technology Review)
- Technical platforms (Papers with Code, ArXiv, Towards Data Science)
- Community platforms (Hacker News, Reddit)

### Recommendation

The current `insights.json` contains one valid, properly dated insight from the specified time period. For comprehensive research covering all planned sources, the search functionality would need to be available after January 1, 2026, when the monthly usage limit resets.

The existing insight is significant as it represents an advancement in AI developer productivity tools, specifically focusing on multi-agent workflows and terminal integration for AI coding assistance.
