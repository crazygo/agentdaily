[system]
You are an AI research analyst specialized in AI developer tools:
code agents, AI IDEs, AI coding CLIs, and related devtools.

Your **global goal**:
- Find genuinely new products that have been publicly launched in the **last 14 days**
- AND that clearly target **programming / code / AI dev workflows**
- THEN summarize only the valid ones in a **clean YAML list**.

You MUST treat the questions in the `user:` section as your **research QUESTION list**.
Each QUESTION is a different “angle” on the same market (e.g., full AI IDE, CLI, workflow-focused, etc.).

To organize your reasoning, use this formula:

> Answer = Sort( Filter( Union(Sources) ) )

You must conceptually follow these four stages:

1. **Sources → candidate list (per QUESTION)**
   - For each QUESTION from the `user:` section:
     - Search the web and relevant directories / launch pages.
     - Collect as many **candidate products** as are reasonably relevant.
   - For each candidate, internally track at least:
     - `name` (product name)
     - `url` (official homepage or primary landing page)
     - `description` (1–3 sentences in English summarizing what it does)
     - `sources` (which QUESTION(s) and which site(s) you saw it on)
   - At this stage you are allowed to over-collect; do **not** filter by date yet unless it is trivial.

2. **Union(candidates) → unified candidate set**
   - Merge candidates across all QUESTIONS into a single conceptual set:
     - Deduplicate products that clearly refer to the same thing
       (same URL, or obviously the same product name + branding).
   - After this step you have a unified **candidate pool**:
     - It may still contain old products, or products outside our domain.

3. **Filter(Union) → filtered candidate list**
   - For each product in the unified pool:
     - Investigate its **launch / first public release date** from credible public info
       (official site, launch post, Product Hunt / HN launch, blog, press, etc.).
     - Decide if it satisfies **both**:
       1) Launch date is within the last **14 days** (relative to “today”).
       2) Product is clearly related to **AI coding / code agents / IDE / dev workflows**.
   - If you cannot reasonably verify that the launch is within 14 days,
     **treat it as NOT valid** and exclude it.
   - Internally keep, for each surviving product:
     - `release_date` in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (best reasonable guess)
     - short one-line justification (do not put the justification in final YAML).

4. **Sort(filtered candidates) → final ordered list**
   - Only work with products that passed the filter.
   - Rank them by a simple mental score combining:
     - **recency** (more recent launch date is better),
     - **attention** (strong launch signal: PH upvotes, HN discussion, X/Reddit buzz),
     - **relevance** (how closely it fits “AI coding agent / IDE / devtool”).
   - You do not need to show the numeric score, just use it to order the list.


### Claude Code / todo-style planning requirements

When running inside Claude Code with access to a `todowrite` (or similar TODO-list) tool,
you MUST first externalize this plan as an explicit TODO list **before** doing any research.

Follow these rules:

0. Start with a planning item: add `Consider how to update todos based on products` as the very first TODO.

1. Based on the QUESTION list in the `user:` section, use the `todowrite` tool to create **one TODO item per QUESTION**.  
   - Each item should correspond to “Sources(QUESTION_i)” — i.e., collecting candidates for that QUESTION.

2. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Union** stage:  
   - e.g. “Union(all source results)” to merge candidates from all QUESTION-based source tasks.

3. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Filter** stage:  
   - e.g. “Filter(union) by launch date ≤ 14 days and AI coding relevance”.

4. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Sort** stage and final write-out:  
   - e.g. “Sort(filtered) and write result to result.yaml (or final-products.yaml)”.

A minimal example of the TODO list structure you are expected to build is (showing the alternating “record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” steps):

TODO List
- [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
...
- [ ] Union(sources from 1 to 3)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Write result to new-product.json
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

You may have more than 3 QUESTION-based source items (e.g. 7), but the pattern MUST be the same:
first all `Sources(QUESTION i)` items, then one `Union(...)`, one or more `Filter(...)` based on the number of unique products, one `Sort(...)`,
and finally one “write result” item.

You should use this TODO list as the execution plan and mark items as completed as you progress.

After all `Sources(QUESTION i)` tasks are done, you MUST rewrite the TODO list:
- Replace the generic filter items with one `Filter(<product name>)` per discovered product (the count of Filter items must equal the number of products).
- Keep `Sort(filtered)` and the final write step after those filter items.

Example refreshed TODO after finding 3 products:
TODO List
- [ ] Filter(Product Alpha)
- [ ] Filter(Product Beta)
- [ ] Filter(Product Gamma)
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Write result to result.yaml

**Progress logging pattern (few-shot)**
- After EVERY action item, add an explicit “Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” item (and mark it done once you rewrite and overwrite the file).
- This enforces a rhythm of: do a step → record progress → rewrite TODO → update `new-product.json` → next step.
- Sample pattern the model should mirror:
  - [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Union(all source results)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sort(filtered)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Write result to new-product.json
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

**Final output format (what you actually return):**

- Return a **JSON array** of products, sorted from most to least interesting.
- Each entry MUST have the following fields:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "name": "<product name>",
      "url": "<official homepage>",
      "description": "1–3 sentence summary of what this product does, focused on the developer / AI-coding use case.",
      "release_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "category": "<short label, e.g. \"AI IDE\", \"AI coding CLI\", \"code agent\", \"workflow agent\">",
      "sources": ["Product Hunt", "Show HN", "Reddit", "X"],
      "community_quotes": [
        "<short quote from community describing what people like or notice>",
        "<up to 5 quotes total, can be paraphrased but must reflect real feedback>"
      ]
    }
  ]
```

* Only include products that:

  * You have **good evidence** were launched in the last 14 days, and
  * Clearly belong to the **AI coding / developer tools** space.

* If you cannot find any products that satisfy the 14-day constraint,
  return an empty JSON array: `[]`.

Be concise, factual, and avoid marketing fluff. Do **not** include your reasoning text
in the final answer—only the JSON.

**File output + incremental updates requirement**
- Maintain a file named `new-product` in the current working directory.
- After every step (including each “Record progress, rewrite todo”), write the current JSON array to `new-product` (overwrite). Early steps may be partial/rough; later steps should be refined.
- The JSON must always be valid and reflect the best current view (start with `[]` if nothing yet).
- After the final step, ensure `new-product` holds the final sorted array.

## Working Directory Context

Your current working directory is: `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2026-02-01`

All file operations should be relative to this directory.

Below is your QUESTION list. For each QUESTION, treat it as a separate “research lens”
to discover newly launched AI coding products (global constraint: last 14 days).

1. QUESTION 1
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that position themselves as a “full AI IDE” (similar to Windsurf or Cursor), not just a small autocomplete plugin.

2. QUESTION 2
   List newly launched AI coding CLIs or terminal-based agents from the last 14 days that behave like Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, or Claude Code CLI (repo-aware, can run commands, can manage tasks).

3. QUESTION 5
   List newly launched AI tools from the last 14 days that focus on one specific developer workflow (for example debugging, refactoring, test generation, or migration) instead of being a general-purpose coding assistant.

4. QUESTION 7
   List newly launched AI code agents from the last 14 days that advertise “project-long memory” or “workspace memory” across multiple sessions (not just single-chat context).

5. QUESTION 11
   List newly launched open-source AI coding agents from the last 14 days that can be self-hosted or run locally by developers.

6. QUESTION 14
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that integrate directly into existing IDEs (such as VS Code, JetBrains, or Neovim) rather than being a standalone IDE.

7. QUESTION 16
   List newly launched AI agents from the last 14 days that help developers run or orchestrate complex workflows across tools (for example CI/CD, deployment, observability, or incident response), rather than only editing code.

I notice there's an issue with the date. The current date is February 1, 2026, and I need to focus on products launched in the last 14 days (January 18 - February 1, 2026). Let me search for more specific launch information and verify each product's actual launch date within this window. Let me also check for any community quotes.

This suggests the launch may have occurred in late January 2025 rather than 2026, as we are currently in 2025.\n\nWould you like me to search for more specific information about Kilo Code's features or its Product Hunt launch details?\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

      "Based on my search results, I found information about Kilo Code on Product Hunt, but there's an important clarification needed about the date.\n\n## Search Results Summary\n\n**Kilo Code** is an **OSS (Open Source) AI coding assistant** that helps with planning, building, and fixing code. According to the search results:\n\n### Recent Launch Success\n- Kilo Code Reviewer launched on Product Hunt recently and achieved **#1 Product of the Day**\n- It's also ranked as **#1 OSS Product of the Day and Week**\n- The product has been received very positively by users\n\n### User Reviews & Feedback\nFrom the reviews and comments found:\n- Many users report it **replaced tools like Cursor, Cline, and Continue**\n- Users appreciate the **fewer retries** and **better control** over rules, memory, and cost\n- One data engineer commented: *\"I've been using Kilo Code reviewer and it's surprisingly data aware, not just code aware\"*\n- The product is described as suitable for both **beginners and pros**\n\n### Product Features\n- Automated code review agents that analyze pull requests\n- Suggests improvements and catches bugs\n- Ensures code quality standards\n- Offers 500+ models (including Claude, GPT, and others)\n- Now includes **local code reviews** directly from your IDE\n- The Kilo Code Reviewer is **completely free** with @MiniMax_AI M2.1\n\n### Note on Date\nWhile you searched for \"January 27, 2026,\" the current search results show that Kilo Code's successful Product Hunt launch happened very recently (references to \"3 days ago\" and \"5 days ago\"). This suggests the launch may have occurred in late January 2025 rather than 2026, as we are currently in 2025.\n\nWould you like me to search for more specific information about Kilo Code's features or its Product Hunt launch details?"

[assistant message #91]
Wait, I need to check the date more carefully. The task requires products from the last 14 days. Today is February 1, 2026, so I need products launched between January 18 and February 1, 2026. Let me verify Claude Cowork's date:

Claude Cowork was launched January 12, 2026, which is **outside** the 14-day window (January 18-February 1). I need to remove it from the list. Let me update the file:

[assistant message #98]
Perfect! Now let me output the final JSON result. The file has been created and saved with all 6 products that were launched within the last 14 days (January 18 - February 1, 2026):

## Summary

I found **6 newly launched AI coding/developer tools** from the last 14 days (January 18 - February 1, 2026):

1. **Mistral Vibe 2.0** (Jan 27) - Terminal-native AI coding CLI from European challenger to GitHub Copilot
2. **Ai2 Open Coding Agents/SERA** (Jan 27) - Open-source agents with 11x lower training costs
3. **Kilo Code Reviewer** (Jan 27) - #1 Product of Day on Product Hunt, AI code review for JetBrains
4. **Kimi Code** (Jan 27) - CLI coding agent from China's Moonshot AI
5. **OpenAI Prism** (Jan 27) - Free AI workspace for scientific coding with GPT-5.2
6. **yolo-cage** (Jan 21) - Security framework preventing AI agents from exfiltrating secrets

**Note:** Claude Cowork was excluded as it launched on January 12, which is outside the 14-day window.

The final sorted list is now saved in `new-product.json`, ranked by recency (January 27 launches first), attention/significance (major company launches like OpenAI and Mistral rank higher), and relevance to AI coding workflows.
