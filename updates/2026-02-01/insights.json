Discusses the phase shift in software engineering caused by LLM agent capabilities crossing a threshold of coherence around December 2025. Key insights: LLMs never get tired, increase stamina dramatically, and enable expansion of what's possible. Also notes potential skill atrophy from reduced manual coding.",
