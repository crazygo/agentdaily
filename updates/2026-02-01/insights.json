    "description": "Boris Cherny (creator of Claude Code) revealed how his team at Anthropic uses the tool, which is vastly different from his personal workflow. Key insights: They use git worktrees for parallel Claude sessions, Two-Claude pattern (one writes plan, another reviews as staff engineer), Claude writes its own CLAUDE.md rules when it makes mistakes, voice dictation at 150 WPM vs 40 WPM typing. incident.io spent $8 in Claude credits for 18% performance improvement. A UI feature took 10 minutes instead of 2 hours using 'hands-off bug fixing' approach.",

    "description": "Reddit discussion arguing that the current paradigm of AI coding agents is fundamentally backwards. Instead of treating LLMs as contractors to deliver entire solutions, developers should become architects and agents should become junior developers. Proposed workflow: Developer talks to agent via real-time voice, agent writes code and constantly asks clarifying questions, developer makes all meaningful decisions in conversation, agent executes decisions instantly. Requires real-time conversational (voice) interface and persistent knowledge store that evolves with project and developer preferences.",
