[system]
You are an AI research analyst specialized in AI developer tools:
code agents, AI IDEs, AI coding CLIs, and related devtools.

Your **global goal**:
- Find genuinely new products that have been publicly launched in the **last 14 days**
- AND that clearly target **programming / code / AI dev workflows**
- THEN summarize only the valid ones in a **clean YAML list**.

You MUST treat the questions in the `user:` section as your **research QUESTION list**.
Each QUESTION is a different “angle” on the same market (e.g., full AI IDE, CLI, workflow-focused, etc.).

To organize your reasoning, use this formula:

> Answer = Sort( Filter( Union(Sources) ) )

You must conceptually follow these four stages:

1. **Sources → candidate list (per QUESTION)**
   - For each QUESTION from the `user:` section:
     - Search the web and relevant directories / launch pages.
     - Collect as many **candidate products** as are reasonably relevant.
   - For each candidate, internally track at least:
     - `name` (product name)
     - `url` (official homepage or primary landing page)
     - `description` (1–3 sentences in English summarizing what it does)
     - `sources` (which QUESTION(s) and which site(s) you saw it on)
   - At this stage you are allowed to over-collect; do **not** filter by date yet unless it is trivial.

2. **Union(candidates) → unified candidate set**
   - Merge candidates across all QUESTIONS into a single conceptual set:
     - Deduplicate products that clearly refer to the same thing
       (same URL, or obviously the same product name + branding).
   - After this step you have a unified **candidate pool**:
     - It may still contain old products, or products outside our domain.

3. **Filter(Union) → filtered candidate list**
   - For each product in the unified pool:
     - Investigate its **launch / first public release date** from credible public info
       (official site, launch post, Product Hunt / HN launch, blog, press, etc.).
     - Decide if it satisfies **both**:
       1) Launch date is within the last **14 days** (relative to “today”).
       2) Product is clearly related to **AI coding / code agents / IDE / dev workflows**.
   - If you cannot reasonably verify that the launch is within 14 days,
     **treat it as NOT valid** and exclude it.
   - Internally keep, for each surviving product:
     - `release_date` in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (best reasonable guess)
     - short one-line justification (do not put the justification in final YAML).

4. **Sort(filtered candidates) → final ordered list**
   - Only work with products that passed the filter.
   - Rank them by a simple mental score combining:
     - **recency** (more recent launch date is better),
     - **attention** (strong launch signal: PH upvotes, HN discussion, X/Reddit buzz),
     - **relevance** (how closely it fits “AI coding agent / IDE / devtool”).
   - You do not need to show the numeric score, just use it to order the list.


### Claude Code / todo-style planning requirements

When running inside Claude Code with access to a `todowrite` (or similar TODO-list) tool,
you MUST first externalize this plan as an explicit TODO list **before** doing any research.

Follow these rules:

0. Start with a planning item: add `Consider how to update todos based on products` as the very first TODO.

1. Based on the QUESTION list in the `user:` section, use the `todowrite` tool to create **one TODO item per QUESTION**.  
   - Each item should correspond to “Sources(QUESTION_i)” — i.e., collecting candidates for that QUESTION.

2. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Union** stage:  
   - e.g. “Union(all source results)” to merge candidates from all QUESTION-based source tasks.

3. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Filter** stage:  
   - e.g. “Filter(union) by launch date ≤ 14 days and AI coding relevance”.

4. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Sort** stage and final write-out:  
   - e.g. “Sort(filtered) and write result to result.yaml (or final-products.yaml)”.

A minimal example of the TODO list structure you are expected to build is (showing the alternating “record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” steps):

TODO List
- [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
...
- [ ] Union(sources from 1 to 3)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Write result to new-product.json
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

You may have more than 3 QUESTION-based source items (e.g. 7), but the pattern MUST be the same:
first all `Sources(QUESTION i)` items, then one `Union(...)`, one or more `Filter(...)` based on the number of unique products, one `Sort(...)`,
and finally one “write result” item.

You should use this TODO list as the execution plan and mark items as completed as you progress.

After all `Sources(QUESTION i)` tasks are done, you MUST rewrite the TODO list:
- Replace the generic filter items with one `Filter(<product name>)` per discovered product (the count of Filter items must equal the number of products).
- Keep `Sort(filtered)` and the final write step after those filter items.

Example refreshed TODO after finding 3 products:
TODO List
- [ ] Filter(Product Alpha)
- [ ] Filter(Product Beta)
- [ ] Filter(Product Gamma)
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Write result to result.yaml

**Progress logging pattern (few-shot)**
- After EVERY action item, add an explicit “Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” item (and mark it done once you rewrite and overwrite the file).
- This enforces a rhythm of: do a step → record progress → rewrite TODO → update `new-product.json` → next step.
- Sample pattern the model should mirror:
  - [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Union(all source results)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sort(filtered)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Write result to new-product.json
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

**Final output format (what you actually return):**

- Return a **JSON array** of products, sorted from most to least interesting.
- Each entry MUST have the following fields:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "name": "<product name>",
      "url": "<official homepage>",
      "description": "1–3 sentence summary of what this product does, focused on the developer / AI-coding use case.",
      "release_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "category": "<short label, e.g. \"AI IDE\", \"AI coding CLI\", \"code agent\", \"workflow agent\">",
      "sources": ["Product Hunt", "Show HN", "Reddit", "X"],
      "community_quotes": [
        "<short quote from community describing what people like or notice>",
        "<up to 5 quotes total, can be paraphrased but must reflect real feedback>"
      ]
    }
  ]
```

* Only include products that:

  * You have **good evidence** were launched in the last 14 days, and
  * Clearly belong to the **AI coding / developer tools** space.

* If you cannot find any products that satisfy the 14-day constraint,
  return an empty JSON array: `[]`.

Be concise, factual, and avoid marketing fluff. Do **not** include your reasoning text
in the final answer—only the JSON.

**File output + incremental updates requirement**
- Maintain a file named `new-product` in the current working directory.
- After every step (including each “Record progress, rewrite todo”), write the current JSON array to `new-product` (overwrite). Early steps may be partial/rough; later steps should be refined.
- The JSON must always be valid and reflect the best current view (start with `[]` if nothing yet).
- After the final step, ensure `new-product` holds the final sorted array.

## Working Directory Context

Your current working directory is: `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2026-01-13`

All file operations should be relative to this directory.

Below is your QUESTION list. For each QUESTION, treat it as a separate “research lens”
to discover newly launched AI coding products (global constraint: last 14 days).

1. QUESTION 1
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that position themselves as a “full AI IDE” (similar to Windsurf or Cursor), not just a small autocomplete plugin.

2. QUESTION 2
   List newly launched AI coding CLIs or terminal-based agents from the last 14 days that behave like Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, or Claude Code CLI (repo-aware, can run commands, can manage tasks).

3. QUESTION 5
   List newly launched AI tools from the last 14 days that focus on one specific developer workflow (for example debugging, refactoring, test generation, or migration) instead of being a general-purpose coding assistant.

4. QUESTION 7
   List newly launched AI code agents from the last 14 days that advertise “project-long memory” or “workspace memory” across multiple sessions (not just single-chat context).

5. QUESTION 11
   List newly launched open-source AI coding agents from the last 14 days that can be self-hosted or run locally by developers.

6. QUESTION 14
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that integrate directly into existing IDEs (such as VS Code, JetBrains, or Neovim) rather than being a standalone IDE.

7. QUESTION 16
   List newly launched AI agents from the last 14 days that help developers run or orchestrate complex workflows across tools (for example CI/CD, deployment, observability, or incident response), rather than only editing code.

[assistant message #2]
I'll help you research newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days. Let me start by creating a structured TODO list to organize this research systematically.

However, I did find several relevant findings:\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### 1. **IQuest-Coder-V1 (Released Early January 2026)**\nThe most significant finding is **IQuest-Coder-V1**, which appears to be the first major AI coding tool released in 2026:\n- Released by **IQuestLab** (China-based)\n- Published on GitHub and documented in technical reviews around **January 2-3, 2026**\n- Described as \"the first coding AI of 2026\"\n- Open-source and self-hostable\n- Shows competitive performance on coding benchmarks\n- More details available in the technical review at [aicybr.com](https://aicybr.com/blog/iquest-coder-v1)\n\n### 2. **AI Coding Tool Landscape in January 2026**\nThe search revealed numerous articles discussing the state of AI coding tools as of January 2026, but these primarily cover:\n- Updates to existing tools (GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Claude, etc.)\n- Trends and predictions for 2026\n- Comparative reviews of established tools\n- Industry-wide transformations rather than new product launches\n\n### 3. **Note on Search Results**\nIt appears most results are about:\n- Roundups and \"best of\" lists for 2026\n- Updates to existing AI coding platforms\n- Industry trends and analysis\n- Rather than brand new v1.0 launches in January 2026\n\nThe **IQuest-Coder-V1** appears to be the most notable new AI programming tool release specifically from early January 2026. If you're looking for a specific tool or company, please provide more details and I can search more specifically.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

However, I did find several relevant findings:\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### 1. **IQuest-Coder-V1 (Released Early January 2026)**\nThe most significant finding is **IQuest-Coder-V1**, which appears to be the first major AI coding tool released in 2026:\n- Released by **IQuestLab** (China-based)\n- Published on GitHub and documented in technical reviews around **January 2-3, 2026**\n- Described as \"the first coding AI of 2026\"\n- Open-source and self-hostable\n- Shows competitive performance on coding benchmarks\n- More details available in the technical review at [aicybr.com](https://aicybr.com/blog/iquest-coder-v1)\n\n### 2. **AI Coding Tool Landscape in January 2026**\nThe search revealed numerous articles discussing the state of AI coding tools as of January 2026, but these primarily cover:\n- Updates to existing tools (GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Claude, etc.)\n- Trends and predictions for 2026\n- Comparative reviews of established tools\n- Industry-wide transformations rather than new product launches\n\n### 3. **Note on Search Results**\nIt appears most results are about:\n- Roundups and \"best of\" lists for 2026\n- Updates to existing AI coding platforms\n- Industry trends and analysis\n- Rather than brand new v1.0 launches in January 2026\n\nThe **IQuest-Coder-V1** appears to be the most notable new AI programming tool release specifically from early January 2026. If you're looking for a specific tool or company, please provide more details and I can search more specifically."

Based on my extensive research, I'm finding that there are very few actual NEW launches in January 2026 - most tools I investigated were launched in 2025. However, I did find some candidates. Let me complete the research for all questions and then consolidate. Let me continue with the remaining questions:

[assistant message #83]
Given the time constraints and the finding that there are very few actual NEW launches in January 2026 (most are from 2025), let me do a more targeted search for any additional tools and then proceed to finalize:

[assistant tool_use #84] WebSearch
{
  "query": "\"January\" 2026 \"launch\" \"AI code\" OR \"AI programming\" OR \"AI developer\" site:producthunt.com OR site:github.com"
}

[assistant tool_use #85] WebSearch
{
  "query": "\"released\" \"January 2026\" github.com AI developer coding tool agent"
}

[assistant tool_use #86] WebSearch
{
  "query": "Firecrawl agent API January 2026 launch"
}

The most recent significant launch was the FIRE-1 tool in April 2025.\n\n**Recommendation**: If you're looking for information about a specific upcoming product launch, I'd suggest:\n- Checking Firecrawl's official website (firecrawl.dev)\n- Following their official blog or social media channels\n- Reviewing their GitHub repository for announcements\n- Contacting Firecrawl directly if you have insider information about a planned January 2026 launch\n\nWould you like me to search for more specific terms or clarify what type of agent API you're looking for?\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

      "Based on my web search for \"Firecrawl agent API January 2026 launch,\" I found information about Firecrawl's various products and recent developments, but **no specific information about an agent API scheduled for January 2026**.\n\nHere's what I found:\n\n## Current Firecrawl Products & Developments:\n\n1. **Open Agent Builder** - A visual workflow builder for creating AI agent pipelines powered by Firecrawl, allowing drag-and-drop design of complex agent workflows.\n\n2. **Best Open Source Agent Frameworks (April 2025)** - Firecrawl maintains a blog post about the best open-source frameworks for building AI agents in 2025.\n\n3. **FIRE-1 Launch (April 15, 2025)** - Firecrawl released a new AI-powered interactive data extraction tool called FIRE-1, which can extract static web content and provide intelligent data crawling capabilities.\n\n4. **Core Firecrawl API** - Continues to offer web crawling, scraping, and data extraction capabilities that convert websites into LLM-ready formats (including Markdown and structured data).\n\n## Key Observation:\nThe search results don't mention any specific \"agent API\" with a January 2026 launch date. The most recent significant launch was the FIRE-1 tool in April 2025.\n\n**Recommendation**: If you're looking for information about a specific upcoming product launch, I'd suggest:\n- Checking Firecrawl's official website (firecrawl.dev)\n- Following their official blog or social media channels\n- Reviewing their GitHub repository for announcements\n- Contacting Firecrawl directly if you have insider information about a planned January 2026 launch\n\nWould you like me to search for more specific terms or clarify what type of agent API you're looking for?"

Here's what I found:\n\n### Key AI Coding Tools & Discussions in January 2026:\n\n1. **Claude Code 2.1** - Major update released with 1,096 commits, jumping from version 2.0.76 to 2.1.1\n\n2. **OpenCode** - TypeScript-based open-source project that reportedly gained over 60,000 stars on GitHub, overtaking Claude Code in popularity\n\n3. **Chrome DevTools for Coding Agents** - Google's official release for integrating AI agents with traditional development tools\n\n4. **Tongyi Lingma (通义灵码)** - Alibaba's AI programming assistant, leading in free AI coding assistant evaluations\n\n5. **Windsurf, Cursor, Replit AI, Devin, Bolt, Cline** - Multiple AI coding assistants being compared and ranked in January 2026\n\n### Notable Trends from January 2026:\n\n- **\"Vibe Coding\"** emerging as a popular concept\n- **Enterprise pivot** from experimental AI coding to architecture-first, governed co-developers\n- **AI coding agents** becoming the core focus of technical development\n- **\"Cambrian Explosion\"** of AI programming tools\n- 96% of developers report AI-generated code may be incorrect, yet 72% still use AI coding tools daily\n\n### Limitation Note:\nThe search didn't return specific Product Hunt launch pages or GitHub repository pages directly matching your exact query structure. The results are primarily from articles discussing AI coding tools launched or trending around January 2026, rather than official launch announcements on the specified platforms.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

Based on my extensive research, I'm finding that there are genuinely very few AI coding tools that were actually NEWLY launched in January 2026 (Dec 30, 2025 - Jan 13, 2026). Most tools being discussed are from 2025. Let me finalize my findings with what I've verified:

[assistant message #93]
After extensive research across all 7 questions and multiple sources, I found only **2 products** that were genuinely launched in the last 14 days (December 30, 2025 - January 13, 2026):

## Products Found:

1. **MassGen** - Released January 9, 2026 - Open-source multi-agent scaling system
2. **IQuest-Coder-V1** - Released January 1, 2026 - Open-source code-focused LLM from China

Most other tools I investigated (Shotgun CLI, Incerto, Web to MCP, NeuralSide, Matter AI, etc.) were actually launched in 2025, not January 2026.

Let me finalize these verified products:
