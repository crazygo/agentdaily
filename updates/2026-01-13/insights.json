    "title": "Best AI Coding Agents for 2026: Real-World Developer Reviews",
    "description": "Comprehensive analysis of the AI coding agent landscape in 2026. Key insights: 85% of developers regularly use AI tools by end of 2025. Top front-runners identified as Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, GitHub Copilot, and Cline. Claude Code described as the 'strongest coding brain' for deep reasoning and debugging. Cursor praised for flow and staying out of the way. Developers increasingly focused on token efficiency, real productivity impact, code quality, and privacy concerns. The conversation has shifted from 'which tool is smartest' to 'which tool won't torch my credits'",
