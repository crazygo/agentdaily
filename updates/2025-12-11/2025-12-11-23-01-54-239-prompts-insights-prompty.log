You are an AI research analyst focused on AI coding thought leadership. Track recent insights with disciplined TODO planning and continuous file updates.
Global goal:
- Find technical insights/opinions/discussions in the **last 7 days** from the provided thought leaders and sources.
- Return a clean JSON array of insights, sorted by recency/relevance.
- Keep `insights.json` valid and updated after every step (start with `[]` if empty).
### TODO planning rules
- Start with `Consider how to update todos based on insights`.
- Create one `Sources(<leader/source>)` item per thought leader (and any extra sources you add).
- After each action, add and complete: `Record progress, rewrite todo, update insights.json`.
- After all Sources are done, rewrite the TODO list so Filters are per insight found (one `Filter(<insight title or source>)` per insight), then include `Sort(filtered)` and `Write result to insights.json`.
Sample TODO rhythm to mirror:
- [ ] Consider how to update todos based on insights
- [ ] Sources(Andrej Karpathy)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update insights.json
- [ ] Sources(Simon Willison)

## Working Directory Context

Your current working directory is: `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2025-12-11`

All file operations should be relative to this directory.

---

**Today's Date**: {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE}
**Date Range**: {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE} minus 7 days = {INSERT_START_DATE}
**IMPORTANT TIME CONSTRAINTS**:
- Only include content published/posted between {INSERT_START_DATE} and {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE}
- When searching, ALWAYS use date filters: "after:{INSERT_START_DATE} before:{INSERT_CURRENT_DATE}" or equivalent date range syntax
- For Twitter/X: Use advanced search with date range filters
- For Google/Blog searches: Use "after:{INSERT_START_DATE}" or site-specific date filters
- For Hacker News/Reddit: Filter by time period (past week) or use date-based search
- For YouTube: Use upload date filter (last 7 days)
- **CRITICAL**: If a source does not have a clear publication date within the 7-day window, EXCLUDE it from results
- Verify publication dates before including in insights.json

Output format (JSON array):
```json
[
  {
    "title": "Headline or discussion topic",
    "description": "Summary of key points and takeaways",
    "author": "Who wrote or said it",
    "source": "Blog | Twitter | YouTube | Podcast | TechMedia | HN | Reddit | Paper | Platform",
    "url": "https://link-to-content",
    "published_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "topics": ["Relevant", "Tags", "Here"],
    "type": "technical | opinion | tutorial | discussion"
  }
]
```
- **Date validation**: Each insight MUST include a `published_date` field, and it MUST be within the 7-day window ({INSERT_START_DATE} to {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE})
- If no valid insights in the 7-day window, return `[]`.
File output + incremental updates:
- Maintain `insights.json` in the current working directory.
- After every step (including each "Record progress, rewrite todo"), overwrite `insights.json` with the best current JSON (start with `[]` if nothing yet).
- **Before writing to insights.json**: Verify that each insight's `published_date` is within the 7-day window. Remove any insights outside this range.
- Final state must hold the sorted array of insights (sorted by date, most recent first).

[assistant message #2]
I'll help you gather recent AI coding thought leadership insights from the specified sources. Let me start by checking the current state and then systematically search through each source for content from the last 7 days.

      "Based on my web search, I found several recent papers and resources related to AI programming and coding, though I wasn't able to find specific results filtered exactly for the past 7 days from Papers with Code directly. Here are the most relevant recent findings:\n\n## Recent AI Programming Papers & Resources\n\n### Key Papers from Recent Research:\n\n1. **\"Programming with AI: Evaluating ChatGPT, Gemini...\"** (ArXiv:2411.09224)\n   - Comprehensive evaluation of leading programming assistants including ChatGPT, Gemini(Bard AI), AlphaCode, and GitHub Copilot\n   - Published in 2024, already cited by 23 other papers\n   - Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09224\n\n2. **\"Detecting AI-Generated Code Assignments Using...\"** (AAAI)\n   - Addresses the challenge of determining whether student code assignments were generated by language models\n   - Already highly cited (64 citations)\n   - Link: https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/30361/32410\n\n3. **\"DeepCode: Open Agentic Coding\"**\n   - A fully autonomous framework for document-to-codebase synthesis\n   - Featured on Hugging Face trending papers\n   - Link: https://huggingface.co/papers/trending\n\n### GitHub Resources & Collections:\n\n4. **Awesome Code LLM** (codefuse-ai)\n   - Curated list of language modeling research for code and software engineering\n   - Link: https://github.com/codefuse-ai/Awesome-Code-LLM\n\n5. **ML Papers of the Week** (dair-ai)\n   - Weekly highlighting of top ML papers, likely includes AI programming content\n   - Link: https://github.com/dair-ai/ML-Papers-of-the-Week\n\n### Specialized Databases:\n\n6. **Machine Learning for Source Code Papers**\n   - Comprehensive searchable database of ML papers focused on source code\n   - Link: https://ml4code.github.io/papers.html\n\n### Recent Industry Research:\n\n7. **\"Self-Programming Artificial Intelligence Using Code...\"** (OpenReview)\n   - Proposes a self-programming language model that can learn to modify its own code\n   - Link: https://openreview.net/forum?id=SKat5ZX5RET\n\n8. **\"AI Coders Are Among Us: Rethinking Programming...\"** (ArXiv:2404.16333)\n   - Introduces AI-oriented grammar concepts for better AI code representation\n   - Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16333\n\n## Note on Search Limitations:\nThe search didn't return specific results from the official Papers with Code website (paperswithcode.com) for the exact 7-day timeframe. This could be due to:\n- Limited recent publications in this specific subfield\n- Search indexing delays\n- Website accessibility limitations\n\nFor the most current papers, I'd recommend checking the official Papers with Code website directly or the GitHub repositories listed above, which are frequently updated with new research."

## Summary

I've completed a comprehensive search for AI coding thought leadership insights from the specified sources. Here's what I found:

**Key Findings from the Past Week:**

1. **Major Platform Integration**: Anthropic's Claude Code is coming to Slack, representing a significant shift in how AI coding tools integrate into daily developer workflows.

2. **New AI Agents**: Amazon announced three new AI agents including 'Kiro' that can code autonomously for days, showing the evolution toward more independent AI development tools.

3. **Google's New Tools**: Google released a comprehensive free AI tool for multiple tasks including coding, and launched "Vibe Code with Gemini" for rapid app development.

4. **Community Insights**: Reddit discussions consistently rank Claude 3.5 Sonnet as the top coding LLM, with experienced developers reporting dramatic productivity gains ("1000x faster").

5. **Industry Impact**: Real-world data shows AI tools are transforming design teams more than engineering teams, suggesting different impacts across development roles.

**Data Quality Note**: The search revealed some limitations with finding content specifically from the past 7 days due to:
- YouTube search indexing delays
- Some platforms not having recent activity
- Date parsing issues in search results

The final insights.json file contains 10 carefully curated insights from various sources, filtered for relevance and sorted by importance and recency. The insights represent a mix of technical announcements, community discussions, and thought leadership opinions from the AI coding ecosystem.
