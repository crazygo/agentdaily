You are an AI research analyst specialized in AI developer tools:
code agents, AI IDEs, AI coding CLIs, and related devtools.

Your **global goal**:
- Find genuinely new products that have been publicly launched in the **last 14 days**
- AND that clearly target **programming / code / AI dev workflows**
- THEN summarize only the valid ones in a **clean YAML list**.

You MUST treat the questions in the `user:` section as your **research QUESTION list**.
Each QUESTION is a different “angle” on the same market (e.g., full AI IDE, CLI, workflow-focused, etc.).

To organize your reasoning, use this formula:

> Answer = Sort( Filter( Union(Sources) ) )

You must conceptually follow these four stages:

1. **Sources → candidate list (per QUESTION)**
   - For each QUESTION from the `user:` section:
     - Search the web and relevant directories / launch pages.
     - Collect as many **candidate products** as are reasonably relevant.
   - For each candidate, internally track at least:
     - `name` (product name)
     - `url` (official homepage or primary landing page)
     - `description` (1–3 sentences in English summarizing what it does)
     - `sources` (which QUESTION(s) and which site(s) you saw it on)
   - At this stage you are allowed to over-collect; do **not** filter by date yet unless it is trivial.

2. **Union(candidates) → unified candidate set**
   - Merge candidates across all QUESTIONS into a single conceptual set:
     - Deduplicate products that clearly refer to the same thing
       (same URL, or obviously the same product name + branding).
   - After this step you have a unified **candidate pool**:
     - It may still contain old products, or products outside our domain.

3. **Filter(Union) → filtered candidate list**
   - For each product in the unified pool:
     - Investigate its **launch / first public release date** from credible public info
       (official site, launch post, Product Hunt / HN launch, blog, press, etc.).
     - Decide if it satisfies **both**:
       1) Launch date is within the last **14 days** (relative to “today”).
       2) Product is clearly related to **AI coding / code agents / IDE / dev workflows**.
   - If you cannot reasonably verify that the launch is within 14 days,
     **treat it as NOT valid** and exclude it.
   - Internally keep, for each surviving product:
     - `release_date` in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (best reasonable guess)
     - short one-line justification (do not put the justification in final YAML).

4. **Sort(filtered candidates) → final ordered list**
   - Only work with products that passed the filter.
   - Rank them by a simple mental score combining:
     - **recency** (more recent launch date is better),
     - **attention** (strong launch signal: PH upvotes, HN discussion, X/Reddit buzz),
     - **relevance** (how closely it fits “AI coding agent / IDE / devtool”).
   - You do not need to show the numeric score, just use it to order the list.


### Claude Code / todo-style planning requirements

When running inside Claude Code with access to a `todowrite` (or similar TODO-list) tool,
you MUST first externalize this plan as an explicit TODO list **before** doing any research.

Follow these rules:

0. Start with a planning item: add `Consider how to update todos based on products` as the very first TODO.

1. Based on the QUESTION list in the `user:` section, use the `todowrite` tool to create **one TODO item per QUESTION**.  
   - Each item should correspond to “Sources(QUESTION_i)” — i.e., collecting candidates for that QUESTION.

2. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Union** stage:  
   - e.g. “Union(all source results)” to merge candidates from all QUESTION-based source tasks.

3. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Filter** stage:  
   - e.g. “Filter(union) by launch date ≤ 14 days and AI coding relevance”.

4. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Sort** stage and final write-out:  
   - e.g. “Sort(filtered) and write result to result.yaml (or final-products.yaml)”.

A minimal example of the TODO list structure you are expected to build is (showing the alternating “record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” steps):

TODO List
- [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
...
- [ ] Union(sources from 1 to 3)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Write result to new-product.json
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

You may have more than 3 QUESTION-based source items (e.g. 7), but the pattern MUST be the same:
first all `Sources(QUESTION i)` items, then one `Union(...)`, one or more `Filter(...)` based on the number of unique products, one `Sort(...)`,
and finally one “write result” item.

You should use this TODO list as the execution plan and mark items as completed as you progress.

After all `Sources(QUESTION i)` tasks are done, you MUST rewrite the TODO list:
- Replace the generic filter items with one `Filter(<product name>)` per discovered product (the count of Filter items must equal the number of products).
- Keep `Sort(filtered)` and the final write step after those filter items.

Example refreshed TODO after finding 3 products:
TODO List
- [ ] Filter(Product Alpha)
- [ ] Filter(Product Beta)
- [ ] Filter(Product Gamma)
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Write result to result.yaml

**Progress logging pattern (few-shot)**
- After EVERY action item, add an explicit “Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” item (and mark it done once you rewrite and overwrite the file).
- This enforces a rhythm of: do a step → record progress → rewrite TODO → update `new-product.json` → next step.
- Sample pattern the model should mirror:
  - [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Union(all source results)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sort(filtered)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Write result to new-product.json
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

**Final output format (what you actually return):**

- Return a **JSON array** of products, sorted from most to least interesting.
- Each entry MUST have the following fields:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "name": "<product name>",
      "url": "<official homepage>",
      "description": "1–3 sentence summary of what this product does, focused on the developer / AI-coding use case.",
      "release_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "category": "<short label, e.g. \"AI IDE\", \"AI coding CLI\", \"code agent\", \"workflow agent\">",
      "sources": ["Product Hunt", "Show HN", "Reddit", "X"],
      "community_quotes": [
        "<short quote from community describing what people like or notice>",
        "<up to 5 quotes total, can be paraphrased but must reflect real feedback>"
      ]
    }
  ]
```

* Only include products that:

  * You have **good evidence** were launched in the last 14 days, and
  * Clearly belong to the **AI coding / developer tools** space.

* If you cannot find any products that satisfy the 14-day constraint,
  return an empty JSON array: `[]`.

Be concise, factual, and avoid marketing fluff. Do **not** include your reasoning text
in the final answer—only the JSON.

**File output + incremental updates requirement**
- Maintain a file named `new-product` in the current working directory.
- After every step (including each “Record progress, rewrite todo”), write the current JSON array to `new-product` (overwrite). Early steps may be partial/rough; later steps should be refined.
- The JSON must always be valid and reflect the best current view (start with `[]` if nothing yet).
- After the final step, ensure `new-product` holds the final sorted array.

## Working Directory Context

Your current working directory is: `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2025-12-30`

All file operations should be relative to this directory.

---

Below is your QUESTION list. For each QUESTION, treat it as a separate “research lens”
to discover newly launched AI coding products (global constraint: last 14 days).

1. QUESTION 1
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that position themselves as a “full AI IDE” (similar to Windsurf or Cursor), not just a small autocomplete plugin.

2. QUESTION 2
   List newly launched AI coding CLIs or terminal-based agents from the last 14 days that behave like Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, or Claude Code CLI (repo-aware, can run commands, can manage tasks).

3. QUESTION 5
   List newly launched AI tools from the last 14 days that focus on one specific developer workflow (for example debugging, refactoring, test generation, or migration) instead of being a general-purpose coding assistant.

4. QUESTION 7
   List newly launched AI code agents from the last 14 days that advertise “project-long memory” or “workspace memory” across multiple sessions (not just single-chat context).

5. QUESTION 11
   List newly launched open-source AI coding agents from the last 14 days that can be self-hosted or run locally by developers.

6. QUESTION 14
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that integrate directly into existing IDEs (such as VS Code, JetBrains, or Neovim) rather than being a standalone IDE.

7. QUESTION 16
   List newly launched AI agents from the last 14 days that help developers run or orchestrate complex workflows across tools (for example CI/CD, deployment, observability, or incident response), rather than only editing code.

[assistant message #2]

This is likely because:\n\n1. **It's currently early 2025** - The search results are from early to mid-2025 (February through September 2025), so December 2025 hasn't occurred yet\n2. **Product launch information that far in advance isn't typically available**\n\nHowever, here are the **current leading AI code editors and IDEs** that are popular in 2025:\n\n### Top AI Code Editors in 2025:\n\n| Tool | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **Cursor** | AI-first code editor, frequently mentioned as a top choice |\n| **Windsurf** | Another leading AI-powered development environment |\n| **VS Code with Copilot** | Traditional IDE integrated with GitHub's AI assistant |\n| **GitHub Copilot** | Code completion and automatic programming tool |\n| **Tabnine** | AI coding assistant |\n| **Continue** | AI-powered coding tool |\n\n### Key Trends in 2025:\n- Multi-agent IDEs where AI teams collaborate on complex tasks\n- Bug fixes, code reviews, and cross-project management powered by AI\n- AI capabilities becoming built-in features in nearly every modern code editor\n- Transition from traditional IDEs with AI integrations to purpose-built AI-first editors\n\nIf you're looking for information about specific product launches, I'd recommend checking back closer to December 2025, or I can search for more recent announcements if any have been made."

Discussion questioning whether AI agents can handle large, messy, multi-step workflows at scale\n   - Users skeptical about real-world implementations beyond demos\n\n2. **Are there any real examples of AI agents doing work?**\n   - Common sentiment: most \"agents\" are just workflow automations that have existed for years\n   - Discussion around what truly constitutes an \"AI agent\"\n\n### Notable AI Agent GitHub Projects (Trending in 2025):\n\n1. **SWE-agent/mini-swe-agent**\n   - \"The 100 line AI agent that solves GitHub issues or helps you in your command line\"\n   - Claims >74% score on benchmarks\n   - Radically simple, no huge configs\n\n2. **Skyvern-AI/skyvern**\n   - Automates browser-based workflows using LLMs and computer vision\n   - Provides a simple API endpoint for workflow automation\n\n3. **agno-agi/agno**\n   - Multi-agent framework, runtime, and control plane\n   - For building private and secure AI products\n\n4. **FoundationAgents/MetaGPT**\n   - Multi-Agent Framework\n   - Launched MGX (MetaGPT X) in February 2025 - described as \"the world's first AI agent development team\"\n\n### Important Context:\n\n- **2025 was widely called \"the year of agents\"** but with significant skepticism about real-world utility\n- Many discussions on HN expressed doubt about whether AI agents were truly intelligent or just glorified workflow automation\n- The search results suggest that while there was considerable activity in the AI agent space, genuinely novel \"Show HN\" projects specifically from December 2025 are not prominently indexed\n\nIf you're looking for specific AI agent frameworks or projects that were released or gained traction in late 2025, I can provide more details about any of the projects mentioned above.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

      "Based on my search, here's what I found related to \"Show HN\" posts about AI agents from around December 2025:\n\n## Key Findings\n\nWhile I couldn't find specific \"Show HN\" AI agent projects posted in December 2025, I did discover relevant context:\n\n### From Hacker News Discussions (Late 2025):\n\n1. **Ask HN: Are Agents Just Hype?** (Nov 15, 2025)\n   - Discussion questioning whether AI agents can handle large, messy, multi-step workflows at scale\n   - Users skeptical about real-world implementations beyond demos\n\n2. **Are there any real examples of AI agents doing work?**\n   - Common sentiment: most \"agents\" are just workflow automations that have existed for years\n   - Discussion around what truly constitutes an \"AI agent\"\n\n### Notable AI Agent GitHub Projects (Trending in 2025):\n\n1. **SWE-agent/mini-swe-agent**\n   - \"The 100 line AI agent that solves GitHub issues or helps you in your command line\"\n   - Claims >74% score on benchmarks\n   - Radically simple, no huge configs\n\n2. **Skyvern-AI/skyvern**\n   - Automates browser-based workflows using LLMs and computer vision\n   - Provides a simple API endpoint for workflow automation\n\n3. **agno-agi/agno**\n   - Multi-agent framework, runtime, and control plane\n   - For building private and secure AI products\n\n4. **FoundationAgents/MetaGPT**\n   - Multi-Agent Framework\n   - Launched MGX (MetaGPT X) in February 2025 - described as \"the world's first AI agent development team\"\n\n### Important Context:\n\n- **2025 was widely called \"the year of agents\"** but with significant skepticism about real-world utility\n- Many discussions on HN expressed doubt about whether AI agents were truly intelligent or just glorified workflow automation\n- The search results suggest that while there was considerable activity in the AI agent space, genuinely novel \"Show HN\" projects specifically from December 2025 are not prominently indexed\n\nIf you're looking for specific AI agent frameworks or projects that were released or gained traction in late 2025, I can provide more details about any of the projects mentioned above."

[assistant message #102]
Now I need to filter these products to verify their launch dates are within the last 14 days. The current date context shows 2025-12-30, so I need to check if products were launched between 2025-12-16 and 2025-12-30. Let me update the todos and begin filtering:
