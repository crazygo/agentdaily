[system]
You are an AI research analyst specialized in AI developer tools:
code agents, AI IDEs, AI coding CLIs, and related devtools.

Your **global goal**:
- Find genuinely new products that have been publicly launched in the **last 14 days**
- AND that clearly target **programming / code / AI dev workflows**
- THEN summarize only the valid ones in a **clean YAML list**.

You MUST treat the questions in the `user:` section as your **research QUESTION list**.
Each QUESTION is a different “angle” on the same market (e.g., full AI IDE, CLI, workflow-focused, etc.).

To organize your reasoning, use this formula:

> Answer = Sort( Filter( Union(Sources) ) )

You must conceptually follow these four stages:

1. **Sources → candidate list (per QUESTION)**
   - For each QUESTION from the `user:` section:
     - Search the web and relevant directories / launch pages.
     - Collect as many **candidate products** as are reasonably relevant.
   - For each candidate, internally track at least:
     - `name` (product name)
     - `url` (official homepage or primary landing page)
     - `description` (1–3 sentences in English summarizing what it does)
     - `sources` (which QUESTION(s) and which site(s) you saw it on)
   - At this stage you are allowed to over-collect; do **not** filter by date yet unless it is trivial.

2. **Union(candidates) → unified candidate set**
   - Merge candidates across all QUESTIONS into a single conceptual set:
     - Deduplicate products that clearly refer to the same thing
       (same URL, or obviously the same product name + branding).
   - After this step you have a unified **candidate pool**:
     - It may still contain old products, or products outside our domain.

3. **Filter(Union) → filtered candidate list**
   - For each product in the unified pool:
     - Investigate its **launch / first public release date** from credible public info
       (official site, launch post, Product Hunt / HN launch, blog, press, etc.).
     - Decide if it satisfies **both**:
       1) Launch date is within the last **14 days** (relative to “today”).
       2) Product is clearly related to **AI coding / code agents / IDE / dev workflows**.
   - If you cannot reasonably verify that the launch is within 14 days,
     **treat it as NOT valid** and exclude it.
   - Internally keep, for each surviving product:
     - `release_date` in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (best reasonable guess)
     - short one-line justification (do not put the justification in final YAML).

4. **Sort(filtered candidates) → final ordered list**
   - Only work with products that passed the filter.
   - Rank them by a simple mental score combining:
     - **recency** (more recent launch date is better),
     - **attention** (strong launch signal: PH upvotes, HN discussion, X/Reddit buzz),
     - **relevance** (how closely it fits “AI coding agent / IDE / devtool”).
   - You do not need to show the numeric score, just use it to order the list.


### Claude Code / todo-style planning requirements

When running inside Claude Code with access to a `todowrite` (or similar TODO-list) tool,
you MUST first externalize this plan as an explicit TODO list **before** doing any research.

Follow these rules:

0. Start with a planning item: add `Consider how to update todos based on products` as the very first TODO.

1. Based on the QUESTION list in the `user:` section, use the `todowrite` tool to create **one TODO item per QUESTION**.  
   - Each item should correspond to “Sources(QUESTION_i)” — i.e., collecting candidates for that QUESTION.

2. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Union** stage:  
   - e.g. “Union(all source results)” to merge candidates from all QUESTION-based source tasks.

3. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Filter** stage:  
   - e.g. “Filter(union) by launch date ≤ 14 days and AI coding relevance”.

4. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Sort** stage and final write-out:  
   - e.g. “Sort(filtered) and write result to result.yaml (or final-products.yaml)”.

A minimal example of the TODO list structure you are expected to build is (showing the alternating “record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” steps):

TODO List
- [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
...
- [ ] Union(sources from 1 to 3)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Write result to new-product.json
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

You may have more than 3 QUESTION-based source items (e.g. 7), but the pattern MUST be the same:
first all `Sources(QUESTION i)` items, then one `Union(...)`, one or more `Filter(...)` based on the number of unique products, one `Sort(...)`,
and finally one “write result” item.

You should use this TODO list as the execution plan and mark items as completed as you progress.

After all `Sources(QUESTION i)` tasks are done, you MUST rewrite the TODO list:
- Replace the generic filter items with one `Filter(<product name>)` per discovered product (the count of Filter items must equal the number of products).
- Keep `Sort(filtered)` and the final write step after those filter items.

Example refreshed TODO after finding 3 products:
TODO List
- [ ] Filter(Product Alpha)
- [ ] Filter(Product Beta)
- [ ] Filter(Product Gamma)
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Write result to result.yaml

**Progress logging pattern (few-shot)**
- After EVERY action item, add an explicit “Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” item (and mark it done once you rewrite and overwrite the file).
- This enforces a rhythm of: do a step → record progress → rewrite TODO → update `new-product.json` → next step.
- Sample pattern the model should mirror:
  - [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Union(all source results)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sort(filtered)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Write result to new-product.json
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

**Final output format (what you actually return):**

- Return a **JSON array** of products, sorted from most to least interesting.
- Each entry MUST have the following fields:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "name": "<product name>",
      "url": "<official homepage>",
      "description": "1–3 sentence summary of what this product does, focused on the developer / AI-coding use case.",
      "release_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "category": "<short label, e.g. \"AI IDE\", \"AI coding CLI\", \"code agent\", \"workflow agent\">",
      "sources": ["Product Hunt", "Show HN", "Reddit", "X"],
      "community_quotes": [
        "<short quote from community describing what people like or notice>",
        "<up to 5 quotes total, can be paraphrased but must reflect real feedback>"
      ]
    }
  ]
```

* Only include products that:

  * You have **good evidence** were launched in the last 14 days, and
  * Clearly belong to the **AI coding / developer tools** space.

* If you cannot find any products that satisfy the 14-day constraint,
  return an empty JSON array: `[]`.

Be concise, factual, and avoid marketing fluff. Do **not** include your reasoning text
in the final answer—only the JSON.

**File output + incremental updates requirement**
- Maintain a file named `new-product` in the current working directory.
- After every step (including each “Record progress, rewrite todo”), write the current JSON array to `new-product` (overwrite). Early steps may be partial/rough; later steps should be refined.
- The JSON must always be valid and reflect the best current view (start with `[]` if nothing yet).
- After the final step, ensure `new-product` holds the final sorted array.

## Working Directory Context

Your current working directory is: `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2025-12-31`

All file operations should be relative to this directory.

Below is your QUESTION list. For each QUESTION, treat it as a separate “research lens”
to discover newly launched AI coding products (global constraint: last 14 days).

1. QUESTION 1
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that position themselves as a “full AI IDE” (similar to Windsurf or Cursor), not just a small autocomplete plugin.

2. QUESTION 2
   List newly launched AI coding CLIs or terminal-based agents from the last 14 days that behave like Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, or Claude Code CLI (repo-aware, can run commands, can manage tasks).

3. QUESTION 5
   List newly launched AI tools from the last 14 days that focus on one specific developer workflow (for example debugging, refactoring, test generation, or migration) instead of being a general-purpose coding assistant.

4. QUESTION 7
   List newly launched AI code agents from the last 14 days that advertise “project-long memory” or “workspace memory” across multiple sessions (not just single-chat context).

5. QUESTION 11
   List newly launched open-source AI coding agents from the last 14 days that can be self-hosted or run locally by developers.

6. QUESTION 14
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that integrate directly into existing IDEs (such as VS Code, JetBrains, or Neovim) rather than being a standalone IDE.

7. QUESTION 16
   List newly launched AI agents from the last 14 days that help developers run or orchestrate complex workflows across tools (for example CI/CD, deployment, observability, or incident response), rather than only editing code.

[assistant message #2]
I'll help you research newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days. Let me start by creating a TODO list to organize this research systematically.

Let me consolidate what I've found so far and create an initial entry in the new-product.json file. From my research, I've identified several potential candidates, but I need to verify their exact launch dates and filter for the 14-day window (December 17-31, 2025). Let me compile the initial findings:

      "Based on the web search results, I found several references to the dates December 28-31, 2025, but **none of the results mention any AI coding developer launches** during this period.\n\nThe search results primarily show:\n\n- **Calendar information** for December 2025 with sunrise/sunset times\n- **National holidays and observances** (National Card Playing Day, National Pepper Pot Day, etc.)\n- **Local events** (park hours, library events, town hall schedules)\n- **Social media posts** and news articles about various non-technical events\n- **Religious services** and daily mass schedules\n- **Birthday/anniversary announcements**\n\nIt appears that either:\n1. No major AI coding developer product launches are scheduled for December 28-31, 2025\n2. Any such announcements haven't been made public yet\n3. The search query didn't match relevant information that may exist\n\n**Note**: As of the current date, we are in early 2025, so these dates are still in the future. Product launches and announcements for late December 2025 may not have been publicly scheduled or announced yet. If you're looking for a specific AI coding tool or developer platform, I recommend checking with the relevant companies directly or monitoring their official announcement channels closer to those dates."

The searches returned general Product Hunt category pages and some unrelated content with those dates.\n\nHowever, I did find some useful information about AI coding/developer tools on Product Hunt more broadly:\n\n## Key AI Coding/Developer Tools on Product Hunt in 2025:\n\n### **AI Code Editors**\n- **Cursor** - Multi-file code editing with deep context\n- **Claude Code** - Agentic code delivery\n- **Windsurf** - Handles complex code changes\n\n### **AI Coding Agents**\n- Tools that automate programming help, suggesting code, refactoring, and debugging\n- Integration with editors, repos, and APIs\n\n### **Other Notable Tools**\n- **Zencoder** - AI coding agent that understands codebases\n- **Devv.AI** - Developer-centric AI search with Stack Overflow and GitHub integration\n- **Kilo Code** - Open-source AI coding assistant\n\n## To find specific launches from December 17-19, 2025, you can:\n\n1. **Visit Product Hunt directly** and navigate to the daily leaderboards:\n   - producthunt.com/leaderboard/daily/2025/12/17\n   - producthunt.com/leaderboard/daily/2025/12/18\n   - producthunt.com/leaderboard/daily/2025/12/19\n\n2. **Check third-party Product Hunt tracking sites** like:\n   - [hunted.space](https://hunted.space/monthly-overview) - Monthly overview of launches\n   - [hunted.space/history](https://hunted.space/history) - Daily launch history\n\nWould you like me to help you with anything else related to AI coding tools or Product Hunt research?"

Based on my extensive research, I need to note an important issue: The search results indicate that December 2025 is in the future relative to the current date. The search queries are returning "future date" responses, which explains why I'm not finding actual product launches for December 17-31, 2025.

Let me re-orient the search to understand what the actual current date is and search for the most recent launches:

[assistant message #97]
Based on my extensive research, I need to provide a summary. Looking at the Product Hunt data from December 18-20, 2025, I can see that none of the top products are specifically AI coding/developer tools that meet our criteria. The products listed are mostly general AI tools, productivity apps, or consumer-focused products.

From all my research, I found only one confirmed AI coding-related tool launch within the December 17-31, 2025 window that clearly meets our criteria:

**GitHub Copilot Agent Skills** - Launched December 18, 2025

Let me write the final result:

[assistant message #115]
Based on my comprehensive research across multiple sources, I found only 3 AI coding/developer tools that clearly launched within the December 17-31, 2025 window and meet our criteria. Let me finalize the result:

## Final Summary

After extensive research across Product Hunt, GitHub, press releases, and developer tool sources, I found **3 products** that were clearly launched in the last 14 days (December 17-31, 2025) and target AI coding/developer workflows:

1. **GitHub Copilot Agent Skills** (Dec 18, 2025) - Custom agent capabilities for GitHub Copilot
2. **Netlify AI Gateway** (Dec 18, 2025) - AI model gateway for developers
3. **cto bench** (Dec 20, 2025) - Code agent benchmarking tool

Note: Several other products were mentioned (like Loki.Build, NOIZ AI, NoteGPT) but they don't clearly fit the AI **coding** / **code agent** / **developer tool** criteria - they're more focused on general AI, productivity, or design workflows.

The research is complete. Here's the final JSON output:
