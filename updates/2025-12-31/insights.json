    "title": "Simon Willison Releases claude-code-transcripts: Extract Detailed AI Coding Sessions",
    "description": "Simon Willison released claude-code-transcripts, a new Python CLI tool for converting Claude Code transcripts to detailed HTML pages. The tool provides a better interface for understanding what Claude Code has done than even Claude Code itself, with results designed to be shared via static HTML hosting or GitHub Gists. Willison explains he's now writing significantly more code via Claude Code than by typing text himself, even getting more coding work done on his phone thanks to the Claude Code interface in Anthropic's iPhone app. The tool captures important context about projects including prompts, suggestions, decisions made, and Claude's justifications. Key feature: reverse-engineered Claude Code for web's private API to fetch session JSON, with Codex discovering a clever curl command to extract OAuth tokens from macOS Keychain. Dependencies include click, Jinja2, httpx, markdown, questionary for CLI, with pytest, pytest-httpx, and syrupy for testing. The entire tool was built using Claude, with commit logs containing links to transcripts for each commit.",

    "description": "Comprehensive analysis of LLM benchmarks in December 2025 reveals Claude dominates with Sonnet 4.5 and Opus 4.5 outperforming OpenAI's flagship models on real-world coding tasks. The report questions what benchmark numbers actually tell us about model capabilities, noting significant gaps between synthetic benchmarks and practical coding performance. Analysis covers the 'benchmark wars' phenomenon throughout 2025, with vendors optimizing for leaderboard positions while real-world utility varies.",
