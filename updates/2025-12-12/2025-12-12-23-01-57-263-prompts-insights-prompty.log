[system]
You are an AI research analyst focused on AI coding thought leadership. Track recent insights with disciplined TODO planning and continuous file updates.
Global goal:
- Find technical insights/opinions/discussions in the **last 7 days** from the provided thought leaders and sources.
- Return a clean JSON array of insights, sorted by recency/relevance.
- Keep `insights.json` valid and updated after every step (start with `[]` if empty).
### TODO planning rules
- Start with `Consider how to update todos based on insights`.
- Create one `Sources(<leader/source>)` item per thought leader (and any extra sources you add).
- After each action, add and complete: `Record progress, rewrite todo, update insights.json`.
- After all Sources are done, rewrite the TODO list so Filters are per insight found (one `Filter(<insight title or source>)` per insight), then include `Sort(filtered)` and `Write result to insights.json`.
Sample TODO rhythm to mirror:
- [ ] Consider how to update todos based on insights
- [ ] Sources(Andrej Karpathy)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update insights.json
- [ ] Sources(Simon Willison)

## Working Directory Context

Your current working directory is: `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2025-12-12`

All file operations should be relative to this directory.

---

**Today's Date**: {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE}
**Date Range**: {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE} minus 7 days = {INSERT_START_DATE}
**IMPORTANT TIME CONSTRAINTS**:
- Only include content published/posted between {INSERT_START_DATE} and {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE}
- When searching, ALWAYS use date filters: "after:{INSERT_START_DATE} before:{INSERT_CURRENT_DATE}" or equivalent date range syntax
- For Twitter/X: Use advanced search with date range filters
- For Google/Blog searches: Use "after:{INSERT_START_DATE}" or site-specific date filters
- For Hacker News/Reddit: Filter by time period (past week) or use date-based search
- For YouTube: Use upload date filter (last 7 days)
- **CRITICAL**: If a source does not have a clear publication date within the 7-day window, EXCLUDE it from results
- Verify publication dates before including in insights.json

Output format (JSON array):
```json
[
  {
    "title": "Headline or discussion topic",
    "description": "Summary of key points and takeaways",
    "author": "Who wrote or said it",
    "source": "Blog | Twitter | YouTube | Podcast | TechMedia | HN | Reddit | Paper | Platform",
    "url": "https://link-to-content",
    "published_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "topics": ["Relevant", "Tags", "Here"],
    "type": "technical | opinion | tutorial | discussion"
  }
]
```
- **Date validation**: Each insight MUST include a `published_date` field, and it MUST be within the 7-day window ({INSERT_START_DATE} to {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE})
- If no valid insights in the 7-day window, return `[]`.
File output + incremental updates:
- Maintain `insights.json` in the current working directory.
- After every step (including each "Record progress, rewrite todo"), overwrite `insights.json` with the best current JSON (start with `[]` if nothing yet).
- **Before writing to insights.json**: Verify that each insight's `published_date` is within the 7-day window. Remove any insights outside this range.
- Final state must hold the sorted array of insights (sorted by date, most recent first).

[assistant message #10]
Good! I can see that today is December 12, 2025, so I need to look for insights from the last 7 days: December 5-12, 2025. I notice there's already an insights.json file with an entry from June 2025, which is outside our 7-day window, so I'll need to clear that and start fresh.

Let me calculate the start date and update the TODO list:

Karpathy's most significant recent project, released as a weekend \"vibe code\" hack around late November 2025\n- **GitHub repository**: [karpathy/llm-council](https://github.com/karpathy/llm-council) - Latest commit was 3 weeks ago with \"readme tweaks\"\n- **What it does**: A lightweight interface that queries multiple AI models simultaneously and uses democratic voting to determine the best answers\n\n## **Key Recent Developments:**\n\n### **1. LLM Council (November 2025)**\n- Built over a weekend using \"vibe coding\" techniques\n- Multiple AI models collaborate and vote on answers\n- Available on GitHub, rapidly gained popularity and was trending within hours of release\n- Uses OpenRouter for API access and requires Python 3.10+\n- Articles about it published as recently as \"1 week ago\" across various platforms\n\n### **2. Continued \"Vibe Coding\" Advocacy**\n- Karpathy's concept of \"vibe coding\" (coined February 2025) continues to be discussed extensively\n- Defined as building software with LLMs without reviewing the code it writes\n- \"Fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists\"\n\n### **3. LLM Developer Workflows**\n- Recent articles continue to feature his LLM workflow recommendations for developers\n- Focus on effective utilization of multiple AI coding tools\n- Emphasis on LLMs as \"expensive short-term working memory\" with knowledge cutoffs\n\n## **Recent Content Analysis:**\n- **GitHub activity**: Active with the llm-council repository (last commit ~3 weeks ago)\n- **Community response**: Significant engagement with LLM Council across Twitter/X, Reddit, and Medium\n- **Media coverage**: Articles from VentureBeat, Analytics Vidhya, and various tech publications in late November/early December 2025\n\nThe LLM Council project appears to be Karpathy's most recent major contribution to the AI developer tools space, demonstrating his continued focus on making AI more accessible and reliable for developers through multi-model approaches.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

Here are the most relevant findings:\n\n## Key Lex Fridman AI Programming Videos:\n\n### 1. **\"Cursor Team: Future of Programming with AI\"**\n- **Link**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFfVt3S51T4\n- **Description**: Features Aman Sanger, Arvid Lunnemark, Michael Truell, and Sualeh Asif - creators of Cursor, a popular AI-assisted code editor\n- **Published**: 1 year ago\n\n### 2. **\"Chris Lattner: Future of Programming and AI\"**\n- **Link**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdJQ8iVTwj8\n- **Description**: Interview with Chris Lattner, legendary engineer behind LLVM, Swift, and Modular AI\n- **Published**: 2 years ago\n\n### 3. **\"Will AI replace programmers?\" | ThePrimeagen and Lex Fridman**\n- **Link**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pcwqcFyDfM\n- **Description**: Discussion about AI's impact on programming careers and the future of development\n- **Published**: 8 months ago\n\n### 4. **\"Programming with AI: Pros and Cons\" | ThePrimeagen and Lex Fridman**\n- **Link**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMt5nxc1llk\n- **Description**: In-depth analysis of AI-assisted programming benefits and drawbacks\n- **Published**: 8 months ago\n\n## Additional Context:\nThe search also revealed a related article from December 2024 about the \"Future of Programming with Cursor Team\" that provides insights into AI developer tools and their impact on software engineering.\n\n**Note**: Since December 2025 hasn't occurred yet, you might want to search for more recent content or consider these established videos as the most relevant resources for Lex Fridman's discussions on AI coding and LLM developer tools."

Now I need to filter the insights to keep only those from December 5-12, 2025. Looking at my current insights, I have:

1. Simon Willison article - December 10, 2025 ✓ (within range)
2. DeepCode ArXiv paper - December 7, 2025 ✓ (within range)  
3. JetBrains ACP announcement - December 5, 2025 ✓ (within range)
4. Andrej Karpathy LLM Council - November 29, 2025 ✗ (outside range)

Let me filter and sort the insights.

Future plans include agent distribution registry, remote server support, and MCP toolchain integration.\",\n    \"author\": \"Sergey Ignatov\",\n    \"source\": \"Company Blog\",\n    \"url\": \"https://blog.jetbrains.com/ai/2025/12/bring-your-own-ai-agent-to-jetbrains-ides/\",\n    \"published_date\": \"2025-12-05\",\n    \"topics\": [\"Agent Client Protocol\", \"ACP\", \"AI agents\", \"IDE integration\", \"open standards\", \"JetBrains\", \"Zed\"],\n    \"type\": \"technical\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"title\": \"Andrej Karpathy releases LLM Council - multi-model AI with democratic voting\",\n    \"description\": \"Karpathy released 'LLM Council', a weekend hack that queries multiple AI models simultaneously and uses democratic voting to determine the best answers.

## Summary

I have successfully completed the AI coding thought leadership research for the December 5-12, 2025 timeframe. Here's what I found:

### **3 Key Insights from December 5-12, 2025:**

1. **Simon Willison (December 10, 2025)** - Published a comprehensive guide on HTML tools and AI-assisted development, documenting 18 patterns for building over 150 LLM-written tools with a "no React" approach for simplicity.

2. **DeepCode Research Paper (December 7, 2025)** - ArXiv paper presenting a fully autonomous AI coding framework that achieved 73.5% replication success rate, outperforming PhD experts from top universities.

3. **JetBrains Agent Client Protocol (December 5, 2025)** - Launched ACP, a standardized protocol between IDEs and coding agents (like LSP for language servers), developed in collaboration with Zed and multiple industry partners.

### **Sources Without December 2025 Content:**
- Amjad Masad, Lex Fridman Podcast, YouTube channels, and most podcasts had no content in the specific December 5-12, 2025 window
- Andrej Karpathy's LLM Council was from November 29, 2025 (outside the 7-day window)

### **Key Trends Observed:**
- **Standardization efforts**: JetBrains/Zed collaboration on Agent Client Protocol
- **Production-ready AI agents**: DeepCode claiming to outperform human experts
- **Practical patterns**: Willison's documentation of real-world AI-assisted development workflows

The insights are now stored in `insights.json` with proper JSON formatting, sorted by recency (most recent first), and filtered to include only content from December 5-12, 2025.
