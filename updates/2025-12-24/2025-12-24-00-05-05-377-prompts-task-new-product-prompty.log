[system]
You are an AI research analyst specialized in AI developer tools:
code agents, AI IDEs, AI coding CLIs, and related devtools.

Your **global goal**:
- Find genuinely new products that have been publicly launched in the **last 14 days**
- AND that clearly target **programming / code / AI dev workflows**
- THEN summarize only the valid ones in a **clean YAML list**.

You MUST treat the questions in the `user:` section as your **research QUESTION list**.
Each QUESTION is a different “angle” on the same market (e.g., full AI IDE, CLI, workflow-focused, etc.).

To organize your reasoning, use this formula:

> Answer = Sort( Filter( Union(Sources) ) )

You must conceptually follow these four stages:

1. **Sources → candidate list (per QUESTION)**
   - For each QUESTION from the `user:` section:
     - Search the web and relevant directories / launch pages.
     - Collect as many **candidate products** as are reasonably relevant.
   - For each candidate, internally track at least:
     - `name` (product name)
     - `url` (official homepage or primary landing page)
     - `description` (1–3 sentences in English summarizing what it does)
     - `sources` (which QUESTION(s) and which site(s) you saw it on)
   - At this stage you are allowed to over-collect; do **not** filter by date yet unless it is trivial.

2. **Union(candidates) → unified candidate set**
   - Merge candidates across all QUESTIONS into a single conceptual set:
     - Deduplicate products that clearly refer to the same thing
       (same URL, or obviously the same product name + branding).
   - After this step you have a unified **candidate pool**:
     - It may still contain old products, or products outside our domain.

3. **Filter(Union) → filtered candidate list**
   - For each product in the unified pool:
     - Investigate its **launch / first public release date** from credible public info
       (official site, launch post, Product Hunt / HN launch, blog, press, etc.).
     - Decide if it satisfies **both**:
       1) Launch date is within the last **14 days** (relative to “today”).
       2) Product is clearly related to **AI coding / code agents / IDE / dev workflows**.
   - If you cannot reasonably verify that the launch is within 14 days,
     **treat it as NOT valid** and exclude it.
   - Internally keep, for each surviving product:
     - `release_date` in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (best reasonable guess)
     - short one-line justification (do not put the justification in final YAML).

4. **Sort(filtered candidates) → final ordered list**
   - Only work with products that passed the filter.
   - Rank them by a simple mental score combining:
     - **recency** (more recent launch date is better),
     - **attention** (strong launch signal: PH upvotes, HN discussion, X/Reddit buzz),
     - **relevance** (how closely it fits “AI coding agent / IDE / devtool”).
   - You do not need to show the numeric score, just use it to order the list.


### Claude Code / todo-style planning requirements

When running inside Claude Code with access to a `todowrite` (or similar TODO-list) tool,
you MUST first externalize this plan as an explicit TODO list **before** doing any research.

Follow these rules:

0. Start with a planning item: add `Consider how to update todos based on products` as the very first TODO.

1. Based on the QUESTION list in the `user:` section, use the `todowrite` tool to create **one TODO item per QUESTION**.  
   - Each item should correspond to “Sources(QUESTION_i)” — i.e., collecting candidates for that QUESTION.

2. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Union** stage:  
   - e.g. “Union(all source results)” to merge candidates from all QUESTION-based source tasks.

3. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Filter** stage:  
   - e.g. “Filter(union) by launch date ≤ 14 days and AI coding relevance”.

4. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Sort** stage and final write-out:  
   - e.g. “Sort(filtered) and write result to result.yaml (or final-products.yaml)”.

A minimal example of the TODO list structure you are expected to build is (showing the alternating “record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” steps):

TODO List
- [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
...
- [ ] Union(sources from 1 to 3)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Write result to new-product.json
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

You may have more than 3 QUESTION-based source items (e.g. 7), but the pattern MUST be the same:
first all `Sources(QUESTION i)` items, then one `Union(...)`, one or more `Filter(...)` based on the number of unique products, one `Sort(...)`,
and finally one “write result” item.

You should use this TODO list as the execution plan and mark items as completed as you progress.

After all `Sources(QUESTION i)` tasks are done, you MUST rewrite the TODO list:
- Replace the generic filter items with one `Filter(<product name>)` per discovered product (the count of Filter items must equal the number of products).
- Keep `Sort(filtered)` and the final write step after those filter items.

Example refreshed TODO after finding 3 products:
TODO List
- [ ] Filter(Product Alpha)
- [ ] Filter(Product Beta)
- [ ] Filter(Product Gamma)
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Write result to result.yaml

**Progress logging pattern (few-shot)**
- After EVERY action item, add an explicit “Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” item (and mark it done once you rewrite and overwrite the file).
- This enforces a rhythm of: do a step → record progress → rewrite TODO → update `new-product.json` → next step.
- Sample pattern the model should mirror:
  - [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Union(all source results)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sort(filtered)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Write result to new-product.json
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

**Final output format (what you actually return):**

- Return a **JSON array** of products, sorted from most to least interesting.
- Each entry MUST have the following fields:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "name": "<product name>",
      "url": "<official homepage>",
      "description": "1–3 sentence summary of what this product does, focused on the developer / AI-coding use case.",
      "release_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "category": "<short label, e.g. \"AI IDE\", \"AI coding CLI\", \"code agent\", \"workflow agent\">",
      "sources": ["Product Hunt", "Show HN", "Reddit", "X"],
      "community_quotes": [
        "<short quote from community describing what people like or notice>",
        "<up to 5 quotes total, can be paraphrased but must reflect real feedback>"
      ]
    }
  ]
```

* Only include products that:

  * You have **good evidence** were launched in the last 14 days, and
  * Clearly belong to the **AI coding / developer tools** space.

* If you cannot find any products that satisfy the 14-day constraint,
  return an empty JSON array: `[]`.

Be concise, factual, and avoid marketing fluff. Do **not** include your reasoning text
in the final answer—only the JSON.

**File output + incremental updates requirement**
- Maintain a file named `new-product` in the current working directory.
- After every step (including each “Record progress, rewrite todo”), write the current JSON array to `new-product` (overwrite). Early steps may be partial/rough; later steps should be refined.
- The JSON must always be valid and reflect the best current view (start with `[]` if nothing yet).
- After the final step, ensure `new-product` holds the final sorted array.

## Working Directory Context

Your current working directory is: `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2025-12-24`

All file operations should be relative to this directory.

Below is your QUESTION list. For each QUESTION, treat it as a separate “research lens”
to discover newly launched AI coding products (global constraint: last 14 days).

1. QUESTION 1
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that position themselves as a “full AI IDE” (similar to Windsurf or Cursor), not just a small autocomplete plugin.

2. QUESTION 2
   List newly launched AI coding CLIs or terminal-based agents from the last 14 days that behave like Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, or Claude Code CLI (repo-aware, can run commands, can manage tasks).

3. QUESTION 5
   List newly launched AI tools from the last 14 days that focus on one specific developer workflow (for example debugging, refactoring, test generation, or migration) instead of being a general-purpose coding assistant.

4. QUESTION 7
   List newly launched AI code agents from the last 14 days that advertise “project-long memory” or “workspace memory” across multiple sessions (not just single-chat context).

5. QUESTION 11
   List newly launched open-source AI coding agents from the last 14 days that can be self-hosted or run locally by developers.

6. QUESTION 14
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that integrate directly into existing IDEs (such as VS Code, JetBrains, or Neovim) rather than being a standalone IDE.

7. QUESTION 16
   List newly launched AI agents from the last 14 days that help developers run or orchestrate complex workflows across tools (for example CI/CD, deployment, observability, or incident response), rather than only editing code.

[assistant message #2]
I'll help you research newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days. Let me start by creating a TODO list to organize this systematic research process.

        "content": "Web search results for query: \"AI IDE launched December 2025 new release cursor windsurf alternative\"\n\nLinks: [{\"title\":\"Top 3 Windsurf Alternatives For Developers in 2025\",\"url\":\"https://www.qodo.ai/blog/windsurf-alternatives/\"},{\"title\":\"10+ Top Windsurf Alternatives in 2025\",\"url\":\"https://www.prismetric.com/windsurf-alternatives/\"},{\"title\":\"The 10 Best Cursor Competitors & Alternatives in 2025\",\"url\":\"https://www.superblocks.com/blog/cursor-competitors\"},{\"title\":\"Windsurf Alternatives: 10 AI Code Editors Compared for 2025\",\"url\":\"https://replit.com/discover/windsurf-alternative\"},{\"title\":\"Best Cursor Alternatives in 2025: AI Code Editors Compared\",\"url\":\"https://nxcode.io/resources/news/cursor-alternative-2025\"},{\"title\":\"Cursor Alternatives in 2026\",\"url\":\"https://www.builder.io/blog/cursor-alternatives-2026\"},{\"title\":\"7 Best Windsurf Alternatives and Competitors\",\"url\":\"https://emergent.sh/learn/best-windsurf-alternatives-and-competitors\"},{\"title\":\"10 best Cursor alternatives for web development with AI\",\"url\":\"https://www.hostinger.com/ca/tutorials/cursor-alternatives\"},{\"title\":\"5 Best Windsurf AI Alternatives for Different Use-Cases\",\"url\":\"https://vitara.ai/windsurf-alternatives/\"},{\"title\":\"10 Best Cursor Alternatives to Consider in 2025-26\",\"url\":\"https://www.openxcell.com/blog/cursor-alternatives/\"}]\n\nI performed a web search for \"AI IDE launched December 2025 new release cursor windsurf alternative\" and found relevant results. Here's what I discovered:\n\n## Search Results Overview\n\nThe search returned several articles about AI IDE alternatives to Cursor and Windsurf from 2025, but none specifically mentioning a new AI IDE launch in December 2025. The results primarily include:\n\n### Key Resources Found:\n\n1. **[Cursor Alternatives in 2026](https://www.builder.io/blog/cursor-alternatives-2026)** (Dec 3, 2025)\n   - Most recent result exploring Cursor alternatives\n\n2. **[10 Best Cursor Alternatives for Web Development](https://www.hostinger.com/ca/tutorials/cursor-alternatives)** (Dec 2, 2025)\n   - Covers Hostinger Horizons, GitHub Copilot, and other alternatives\n\n3. **[Best Cursor Alternatives in 2025: AI Code Editors Compared](https://nxcode.io/resources/news/cursor-alternative-2025)** (Nov 30, 2025)\n   - Compares Windsurf, GitHub Copilot, Nxcode, and more\n\n### Main Alternatives Mentioned:\n- **Qodo** - Positioned as a Windsurf alternative\n- **GitHub Copilot** - Ecosystem leader\n- **Replit Agent** - Full-stack cloud platform\n- **JetBrains AI** - For teams wanting AI in existing IDEs\n- **Nxcode, Vitara, Lovable, Bubble, Emergent** - Various specialized alternatives\n- **Zed, Cline** - Different use cases\n\n### Notable Gap:\nThe search didn't surface any specific AI IDE launches from December 2025. However, the Dec 2-3, 2025 articles about Cursor and Windsurf alternatives suggest the AI IDE market is actively evolving. You might want to search more specifically for a particular product name if you have one in mind, or check tech news outlets like TechCrunch or Hacker News for late 2025 AI IDE launches.\n\nWould you like me to search for more specific terms or explore any of these alternatives in detail?\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

      "I performed a web search for \"AI IDE launched December 2025 new release cursor windsurf alternative\" and found relevant results. Here's what I discovered:\n\n## Search Results Overview\n\nThe search returned several articles about AI IDE alternatives to Cursor and Windsurf from 2025, but none specifically mentioning a new AI IDE launch in December 2025. The results primarily include:\n\n### Key Resources Found:\n\n1. **[Cursor Alternatives in 2026](https://www.builder.io/blog/cursor-alternatives-2026)** (Dec 3, 2025)\n   - Most recent result exploring Cursor alternatives\n\n2. **[10 Best Cursor Alternatives for Web Development](https://www.hostinger.com/ca/tutorials/cursor-alternatives)** (Dec 2, 2025)\n   - Covers Hostinger Horizons, GitHub Copilot, and other alternatives\n\n3. **[Best Cursor Alternatives in 2025: AI Code Editors Compared](https://nxcode.io/resources/news/cursor-alternative-2025)** (Nov 30, 2025)\n   - Compares Windsurf, GitHub Copilot, Nxcode, and more\n\n### Main Alternatives Mentioned:\n- **Qodo** - Positioned as a Windsurf alternative\n- **GitHub Copilot** - Ecosystem leader\n- **Replit Agent** - Full-stack cloud platform\n- **JetBrains AI** - For teams wanting AI in existing IDEs\n- **Nxcode, Vitara, Lovable, Bubble, Emergent** - Various specialized alternatives\n- **Zed, Cline** - Different use cases\n\n### Notable Gap:\nThe search didn't surface any specific AI IDE launches from December 2025. However, the Dec 2-3, 2025 articles about Cursor and Windsurf alternatives suggest the AI IDE market is actively evolving. You might want to search more specifically for a particular product name if you have one in mind, or check tech news outlets like TechCrunch or Hacker News for late 2025 AI IDE launches.\n\nWould you like me to search for more specific terms or explore any of these alternatives in detail?"

However, I found several relevant developments and recent updates in the AI IDE space:\n\n## Recent AI IDE Developments:\n\n### 1. **Cursor 2.1 Update** (November 21, 2025)\n- Released just before December\n- Improved Plan Mode\n- AI Code Review in Editor\n- Instant Grep functionality\n\n### 2. **Google Antigravity** (November 20, 2025)\n- Google released a new **agentic development platform**\n- Lets agents autonomously plan, execute, and verify complex tasks\n- Available as public preview\n- Could be considered a significant AI IDE-related release\n\n### 3. **Funding News** (November 13, 2025)\n- **Cursor** (AI code editor) raised $2.3 billion funding round\n- Backed by Nvidia and Google\n- Valued at $29.3 billion\n- This may lead to new feature announcements\n\n### Major AI IDEs Available in 2025:\n- **Cursor** - AI-first code editor\n- **Windsurf** (formerly Codeium) - Agent-native IDE\n- **VS Code with Copilot** - Microsoft's AI integration\n- **Zed** - Performance-focused editor with AI\n- **Trae** - ByteDance's AI IDE (China)\n\n**Note:** Most of the activity in late 2025 appears to be updates and funding rather than completely new IDE launches. If you're looking for a specific AI IDE or have a particular tool in mind, please provide more details and I can search more specifically.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

If you're looking for a specific AI IDE or have a particular tool in mind, please provide more details and I can search more specifically."

The search results appear to be primarily from other tech publications and blogs.

Based on my research, I found that Cursor launched a Visual Editor on December 11, 2025, which falls within our 14-day window. Let me continue collecting more candidates and then record progress. Let me search for more recent launches across different sources:

However, I found several relevant AI CLI tools and developments from 2025:\n\n## Major AI CLI Tools in 2025:\n\n### 1. **Gemini CLI** (Launched June 25, 2025)\n- Google's open-source AI agent that brings Gemini directly into developers' terminals\n- Free and open source\n- Offers lightweight access to Gemini's capabilities\n- Recently updated to include Gemini 3 Flash (6 days ago)\n- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli)\n\n### 2. **Codex CLI** (Launched April 2025)\n- OpenAI's open-source coding tool\n- Focused on speed and efficiency\n- Built in Rust\n\n### 3. **Toad** (Mid-2025)\n- A unified experience for AI in the terminal\n- Developed to provide integrated AI functionality for terminal users\n\n### 4. **Agentic CLI Era** (Throughout 2025)\n- The industry has been moving beyond simple IDE chatbots toward \"agentic CLIs\"\n- This represents a new wave of software development tools\n\n## Related Resources:\n- **Dec 15, 2025**: Article on \"How AI is Revolutionizing Command Line Interface (CLI) in 2025\"\n- **Dec 2, 2025**: Google added GUI features to Gemini CLI\n- **Recent developments**: Multiple articles discussing the rise of AI coding assistants specifically designed for terminal environments\n\n**Note**: December 2025 is very recent, and any launches from this month might not yet be indexed or widely documented. The search results show the broader trend of AI CLI tools throughout 2025, with June and April being the key launch periods for major tools."

However, I found substantial information about Junie's developer feedback and reviews from 2025.

It's designed to handle tasks independently while keeping developers in control.\n\n## Key Developer Feedback & Reviews\n\n### ✅ **Positive Feedback**\n\n**Integration & Quality:**\n- \"Junie is one of the best coding agents I've been trying out so far. Very well integrated with IntelliJ, great for Kotlin, and the test-first focus makes it effective.\"\n- Strong praise for deep code understanding and ability to work with project structure\n- Recognized in Gartner's 2025 Magic Quadrant for AI Code Assistants\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Excellent for early-stage prototyping and structured workflows\n- Test-first development approach\n- Maintains context within the JetBrains ecosystem\n- Ability to fully delegate routine tasks\n\n### ❌ **Negative Feedback & Criticisms**\n\n**Performance Issues:**\n- **Speed:** Frequently described as \"slow\" or \"very slow\" – sometimes taking 30+ seconds for responses\n- Compared unfavorably to competitors like Cursor and Claude Code in terms of speed\n\n**Cost & Pricing Concerns:**\n- **Paid subscription required** (unlike some competitors)\n- **Only works with IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate**, not the Community Edition\n- Credit/quota system lacks transparency, causing frustration among users\n- Some developers reported quota depletion after just 8 days of use\n\n**Functional Limitations:**\n- Struggles with understanding large code blocks (over a couple kilobytes)\n- One review stated it's \"still very bad\" despite JetBrains responding to feedback\n\n### 🔄 **Mixed Experiences**\n\nReddit discussions show divided opinions:\n- \"Junie is slow... but absolutely great!\" – acknowledging the trade-off between thoroughness and speed\n- Some see it as a potential \"Cursor killer\" despite performance issues\n- Others prefer more responsive alternatives\n\n## Summary\nAs of late 2025, Junie shows promise but faces challenges. Developers appreciate its deep integration and methodical approach, but concerns about **speed, pricing, and transparency** remain significant pain points. JetBrains appears to be actively developing the product based on ongoing feedback.\n\nWould you like me to search for more specific aspects of Junie's performance or compare it to particular alternatives?\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."
