As of December 30, 2025, the top 5 models on Artificial Analysis leaderboard are all Chinese: GLM-4.7, Kimi K2 Thinking, MiMo-V2-Flash, DeepSeek V3.2, and MiniMax-M2.1. DeepSeek R1's release in January triggered a $593bn NVIDIA market cap drop as investors panicked that AI wasn't an American monopoly. Most of these models are fully open source under Apache 2.0 or MIT licenses. Key labs include DeepSeek, Alibaba Qwen, Moonshot AI (Kimi), Z.ai (GLM), and MiniMax. Many are competitive with Claude 4 Sonnet and GPT-5, with advances in efficient training and inference.",

This demonstrates that developers will embrace LLMs on the command line when given powerful enough models and the right harness. Claude Code emerged as the first convincing demonstration of an LLM Agent - an AI that 'lives on your computer' with your private environment, data, and context. The key distinction is not about where AI ops run (cloud vs local), but about the already-existing computer with its installation, context, data, secrets, configuration, and low-latency interaction.",

Unlike traditional image generation, Nano Banana can generate useful text within images, making it capable of creating detailed infographics and professional-grade visual materials. The model demonstrates that LLMs should speak to humans in their favored format - images, infographics, slides, whiteboards, animations/videos, web apps - rather than just text. 'Chatting with LLMs is a bit like issuing commands to a computer console in the 1980s' - Nano Banana represents the emergence of LLM GUIs.",

    "description": "Simon Willison highlights a critical security issue: most coding agents default to asking for user confirmation for every action, but running them in 'YOLO mode' (automatic approval) feels like a completely different product. Asynchronous coding agents like Claude Code for web and Codex Cloud can run in YOLO mode by default since there's no personal computer to damage. Willison cites Johann Rehberger's 'The Normalization of Deviance in AI' which describes how repeated exposure to risky behavior without negative consequences leads people and organizations to accept that risky behavior as normal - originally described in context of the 1986 Space Shuttle Challenger disaster. The longer we get away with running these systems in insecure ways, the closer we are getting to a disaster of our own.",

Reasoning models with access to tools can plan out multi-step tasks, execute them, and continue to reason about the results to update their plans. This makes AI-assisted search actually work - complex research questions can be answered by GPT-5 Thinking. Reasoning models are also exceptional at producing and debugging code - they can start with an error and step through many layers of the codebase to find root causes. The combination of reasoning with tool-use enables AI agents that can perform useful work via tool calls over multiple steps. Every major AI lab released at least one reasoning model in 2025.",
