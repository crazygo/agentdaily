[system]
You are an AI research analyst specialized in AI developer tools:
code agents, AI IDEs, AI coding CLIs, and related devtools.

Your **global goal**:
- Find genuinely new products that have been publicly launched in the **last 14 days**
- AND that clearly target **programming / code / AI dev workflows**
- THEN summarize only the valid ones in a **clean YAML list**.

You MUST treat the questions in the `user:` section as your **research QUESTION list**.
Each QUESTION is a different “angle” on the same market (e.g., full AI IDE, CLI, workflow-focused, etc.).

To organize your reasoning, use this formula:

> Answer = Sort( Filter( Union(Sources) ) )

You must conceptually follow these four stages:

1. **Sources → candidate list (per QUESTION)**
   - For each QUESTION from the `user:` section:
     - Search the web and relevant directories / launch pages.
     - Collect as many **candidate products** as are reasonably relevant.
   - For each candidate, internally track at least:
     - `name` (product name)
     - `url` (official homepage or primary landing page)
     - `description` (1–3 sentences in English summarizing what it does)
     - `sources` (which QUESTION(s) and which site(s) you saw it on)
   - At this stage you are allowed to over-collect; do **not** filter by date yet unless it is trivial.

2. **Union(candidates) → unified candidate set**
   - Merge candidates across all QUESTIONS into a single conceptual set:
     - Deduplicate products that clearly refer to the same thing
       (same URL, or obviously the same product name + branding).
   - After this step you have a unified **candidate pool**:
     - It may still contain old products, or products outside our domain.

3. **Filter(Union) → filtered candidate list**
   - For each product in the unified pool:
     - Investigate its **launch / first public release date** from credible public info
       (official site, launch post, Product Hunt / HN launch, blog, press, etc.).
     - Decide if it satisfies **both**:
       1) Launch date is within the last **14 days** (relative to “today”).
       2) Product is clearly related to **AI coding / code agents / IDE / dev workflows**.
   - If you cannot reasonably verify that the launch is within 14 days,
     **treat it as NOT valid** and exclude it.
   - Internally keep, for each surviving product:
     - `release_date` in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (best reasonable guess)
     - short one-line justification (do not put the justification in final YAML).

4. **Sort(filtered candidates) → final ordered list**
   - Only work with products that passed the filter.
   - Rank them by a simple mental score combining:
     - **recency** (more recent launch date is better),
     - **attention** (strong launch signal: PH upvotes, HN discussion, X/Reddit buzz),
     - **relevance** (how closely it fits “AI coding agent / IDE / devtool”).
   - You do not need to show the numeric score, just use it to order the list.


### Claude Code / todo-style planning requirements

When running inside Claude Code with access to a `todowrite` (or similar TODO-list) tool,
you MUST first externalize this plan as an explicit TODO list **before** doing any research.

Follow these rules:

0. Start with a planning item: add `Consider how to update todos based on products` as the very first TODO.

1. Based on the QUESTION list in the `user:` section, use the `todowrite` tool to create **one TODO item per QUESTION**.  
   - Each item should correspond to “Sources(QUESTION_i)” — i.e., collecting candidates for that QUESTION.

2. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Union** stage:  
   - e.g. “Union(all source results)” to merge candidates from all QUESTION-based source tasks.

3. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Filter** stage:  
   - e.g. “Filter(union) by launch date ≤ 14 days and AI coding relevance”.

4. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Sort** stage and final write-out:  
   - e.g. “Sort(filtered) and write result to result.yaml (or final-products.yaml)”.

A minimal example of the TODO list structure you are expected to build is (showing the alternating “record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” steps):

TODO List
- [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
...
- [ ] Union(sources from 1 to 3)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Write result to new-product.json
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

You may have more than 3 QUESTION-based source items (e.g. 7), but the pattern MUST be the same:
first all `Sources(QUESTION i)` items, then one `Union(...)`, one or more `Filter(...)` based on the number of unique products, one `Sort(...)`,
and finally one “write result” item.

You should use this TODO list as the execution plan and mark items as completed as you progress.

After all `Sources(QUESTION i)` tasks are done, you MUST rewrite the TODO list:
- Replace the generic filter items with one `Filter(<product name>)` per discovered product (the count of Filter items must equal the number of products).
- Keep `Sort(filtered)` and the final write step after those filter items.

Example refreshed TODO after finding 3 products:
TODO List
- [ ] Filter(Product Alpha)
- [ ] Filter(Product Beta)
- [ ] Filter(Product Gamma)
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Write result to result.yaml

**Progress logging pattern (few-shot)**
- After EVERY action item, add an explicit “Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” item (and mark it done once you rewrite and overwrite the file).
- This enforces a rhythm of: do a step → record progress → rewrite TODO → update `new-product.json` → next step.
- Sample pattern the model should mirror:
  - [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Union(all source results)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sort(filtered)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Write result to new-product.json
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

**Final output format (what you actually return):**

- Return a **JSON array** of products, sorted from most to least interesting.
- Each entry MUST have the following fields:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "name": "<product name>",
      "url": "<official homepage>",
      "description": "1–3 sentence summary of what this product does, focused on the developer / AI-coding use case.",
      "release_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "category": "<short label, e.g. \"AI IDE\", \"AI coding CLI\", \"code agent\", \"workflow agent\">",
      "sources": ["Product Hunt", "Show HN", "Reddit", "X"],
      "community_quotes": [
        "<short quote from community describing what people like or notice>",
        "<up to 5 quotes total, can be paraphrased but must reflect real feedback>"
      ]
    }
  ]
```

* Only include products that:

  * You have **good evidence** were launched in the last 14 days, and
  * Clearly belong to the **AI coding / developer tools** space.

* If you cannot find any products that satisfy the 14-day constraint,
  return an empty JSON array: `[]`.

Be concise, factual, and avoid marketing fluff. Do **not** include your reasoning text
in the final answer—only the JSON.

**File output + incremental updates requirement**
- Maintain a file named `new-product` in the current working directory.
- After every step (including each “Record progress, rewrite todo”), write the current JSON array to `new-product` (overwrite). Early steps may be partial/rough; later steps should be refined.
- The JSON must always be valid and reflect the best current view (start with `[]` if nothing yet).
- After the final step, ensure `new-product` holds the final sorted array.

## Working Directory Context

Your current working directory is: `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2026-01-05`

All file operations should be relative to this directory.

Below is your QUESTION list. For each QUESTION, treat it as a separate “research lens”
to discover newly launched AI coding products (global constraint: last 14 days).

1. QUESTION 1
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that position themselves as a “full AI IDE” (similar to Windsurf or Cursor), not just a small autocomplete plugin.

2. QUESTION 2
   List newly launched AI coding CLIs or terminal-based agents from the last 14 days that behave like Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, or Claude Code CLI (repo-aware, can run commands, can manage tasks).

3. QUESTION 5
   List newly launched AI tools from the last 14 days that focus on one specific developer workflow (for example debugging, refactoring, test generation, or migration) instead of being a general-purpose coding assistant.

4. QUESTION 7
   List newly launched AI code agents from the last 14 days that advertise “project-long memory” or “workspace memory” across multiple sessions (not just single-chat context).

5. QUESTION 11
   List newly launched open-source AI coding agents from the last 14 days that can be self-hosted or run locally by developers.

6. QUESTION 14
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that integrate directly into existing IDEs (such as VS Code, JetBrains, or Neovim) rather than being a standalone IDE.

7. QUESTION 16
   List newly launched AI agents from the last 14 days that help developers run or orchestrate complex workflows across tools (for example CI/CD, deployment, observability, or incident response), rather than only editing code.

However, I didn't find specific information about a **new AI code editor that launched in January 2026**.\n\nHere's what the search revealed:\n\n## Key Findings:\n\n### AI Code Editor Reviews and Rankings for 2026:\n- **Best AI Code Editors 2026** - PlayCode blog published on December 24, 2025, comparing Cursor, VS Code + Copilot, PlayCode, Windsurf, Zed, and others\n- **AI Programming Software Evaluation: 10 Most Worth-Watching AI Programming Software in 2026** - Articles from December 27, 2025 mentioning tools like Trae, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and others\n\n### Notable Mentions:\n- **Trae** - Highlighted as having a highly active community and positioned as a core intelligent development partner\n- **Cursor** - Frequently mentioned as a leading AI-first code editor\n- **Visual Studio 2026** - Microsoft announced at .NET Conf 2025 (November 12, 2025), described as an \"AI-driven full-stack\" development environment\n\n### Industry Analysis:\n- Articles discuss how AI coding tools are evolving beyond parameter competition to focus on developer dependency (\"不拼参数，拼谁能让开发者'戒不掉'\")\n\n**Note:** The search results primarily show articles from December 2025 discussing AI code editors heading into 2026, but no specific launch of a new AI code editor in January 2026 was found in these results. This could be because:\n1. The launch may not have occurred yet\n2. It may be too recent to be indexed\n3. It might require a more specific search query\n\nWould you like me to search for a specific AI code editor or company name, or would you prefer to refine the search query?"

I notice that I've been searching for tools in December 2025 and January 2026, but I need to clarify the actual current date. Looking at the working directory context, it shows "2026-01-05", so I should search for tools launched between December 22, 2025 and January 5, 2026. Let me search more specifically:

The search may not have found results because there are no historical records of January 2026 releases, and any announcements of planned January 2026 releases would typically be speculative or pre-announcements.\n\nIf you're looking for information about upcoming releases or predictions for early 2026, I'd recommend checking technology news sources closer to that time period.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

      "Based on my search for \"January 2026 AI coding tool launched released new,\" I didn't find any specific AI coding tools that were launched or released specifically in January 2026. Here's what the search results show:\n\n## Key Findings:\n\n**Recent AI Coding Tool Releases (2025):**\n\n1. **OpenAI Codex** - Launched in May 2025 as an agentic AI coding agent integrated into ChatGPT, built on the o3 reasoning model\n2. **GPT-5.2-Codex** - Released by OpenAI in December 2025 as an advanced agentic coding model for professional software engineering\n3. **Google Antigravity** - Announced in November 2025 as Google's new agentic development platform\n\n**Current Landscape as of Late 2025:**\n- AI coding tools have become widespread across the industry\n- Tools like OpenHands, Gemini Code Assist, and various open-source AI coding assistants are available\n- The industry is focused on \"agentic\" coding tools that can autonomously plan and execute complex software development tasks\n\n**Looking Forward to 2026:**\n- The search results mention \"12 AI Coding Emerging Trends That Will Dominate 2026,\" suggesting continued evolution in the space\n- Articles from December 2025 discuss how AI coding has become ubiquitous, with many developers adopting these tools\n\n**Note:** Since we're currently in June 2025, January 2026 hasn't occurred yet. The search may not have found results because there are no historical records of January 2026 releases, and any announcements of planned January 2026 releases would typically be speculative or pre-announcements.\n\nIf you're looking for information about upcoming releases or predictions for early 2026, I'd recommend checking technology news sources closer to that time period."

[assistant message #75]
Excellent! I now have enough information to compile my findings. Let me update my todo list and record the progress. Based on my research, I've found that:

1. **IQuest-Coder-V1** - Released January 2, 2026 (within the last 14 days from Jan 5, 2026)
2. **GLM-4.7** - Released December 22, 2025 (within the last 14 days from Jan 5, 2026)

However, I notice GLM-4.7 was released on December 22, 2025, which is exactly 14 days from January 5, 2026. Let me verify the exact date and continue gathering information:

[assistant message #86]
Based on my research, GLM-4.7 was released on December 22-23, 2025, which falls outside the 14-day window from January 5, 2026 (which would be December 22, 2025 at the earliest, but this is borderline). However, the original new-product.json file already had GLM-4.7 listed with a release date of December 22, 2025, so I should respect that existing data.

Let me now proceed with the Union, Filter, and Sort steps:

[assistant message #89]
Now let me analyze the dates:

- **IQuest-Coder-V1**: Released January 2, 2026 - This is WITHIN the 14-day window (January 5, 2026 minus 14 days = December 22, 2025)
- **GLM-4.7**: Released December 22, 2025 - This is BORDERLINE (exactly 14 days). Let me check if this should be included.

Based on the original file content, GLM-4.7 was already included. However, December 22, 2025 to January 5, 2026 is exactly 14 days, so it falls at the boundary. I'll include it but prioritize IQuest-Coder-V1 as it's more recent.

[assistant message #92]
Actually, upon closer review, GLM-4.7 was released December 22, 2025, which is exactly 14 days before January 5, 2026. However, the standard interpretation of "within the last 14 days" typically means products launched between December 22, 2025 (inclusive) and January 5, 2026. Since GLM-4.7 was released on December 22, 2025, it technically falls within this window.

But I also noticed that my research shows CircleCI Chunk was launched in September 2025 and went to open preview in November 2025, which is well outside the 14-day window.

Let me finalize the sorted list with only the products that genuinely fall within the December 22, 2025 - January 5, 2026 window:

[assistant message #97]
Perfect! I have completed my research and compiled the results. Here's a summary of my findings:

## Research Summary

I conducted a comprehensive search across 7 different research angles (QUESTIONS) covering:
1. Full AI IDEs
2. AI coding CLIs/terminal agents
3. Single-workflow AI dev tools
4. AI agents with project/workspace memory
5. Open-source AI coding agents
6. AI tools integrating into existing IDEs
7. AI workflow orchestration agents

### Key Finding

After extensive research across Product Hunt, GitHub, Hacker News, tech news sites, and developer communities, I found **only one product** that meets all the criteria:

- **Launched within the last 14 days** (December 22, 2025 - January 5, 2026)
- **Clearly targets AI coding/developer workflows**
- **Has verifiable launch date and public availability**

### Product Found

**IQuest-Coder-V1** (Released January 2, 2026)
- 40B parameter open-source code LLM from China
- Developed by Ubiquant Investment's IQuest Research Institute
- Claims competitive performance with Claude Sonnet 4.5 and GPT-5.1
- Features innovative Code-Flow multi-stage training
- Fully open-source and self-hostable

### Notable Exclusions

Several products were mentioned in my research but did **not** meet the 14-day criteria:
- **GLM-4.7** (Zhipu AI) - Released December 22, 2025 (borderline, but excluded to maintain strict 14-day window)
- **CircleCI Chunk** - Launched September 2025, open preview November 2025
- **OpenCode, Gemini CLI, Codex CLI** - All launched earlier in 2025

The final result has been written to `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2026-01-05/new-product.json` in the required JSON format.
