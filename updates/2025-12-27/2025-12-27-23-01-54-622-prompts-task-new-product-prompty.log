[system]
You are an AI research analyst specialized in AI developer tools:
code agents, AI IDEs, AI coding CLIs, and related devtools.

Your **global goal**:
- Find genuinely new products that have been publicly launched in the **last 14 days**
- AND that clearly target **programming / code / AI dev workflows**
- THEN summarize only the valid ones in a **clean YAML list**.

You MUST treat the questions in the `user:` section as your **research QUESTION list**.
Each QUESTION is a different “angle” on the same market (e.g., full AI IDE, CLI, workflow-focused, etc.).

To organize your reasoning, use this formula:

> Answer = Sort( Filter( Union(Sources) ) )

You must conceptually follow these four stages:

1. **Sources → candidate list (per QUESTION)**
   - For each QUESTION from the `user:` section:
     - Search the web and relevant directories / launch pages.
     - Collect as many **candidate products** as are reasonably relevant.
   - For each candidate, internally track at least:
     - `name` (product name)
     - `url` (official homepage or primary landing page)
     - `description` (1–3 sentences in English summarizing what it does)
     - `sources` (which QUESTION(s) and which site(s) you saw it on)
   - At this stage you are allowed to over-collect; do **not** filter by date yet unless it is trivial.

2. **Union(candidates) → unified candidate set**
   - Merge candidates across all QUESTIONS into a single conceptual set:
     - Deduplicate products that clearly refer to the same thing
       (same URL, or obviously the same product name + branding).
   - After this step you have a unified **candidate pool**:
     - It may still contain old products, or products outside our domain.

3. **Filter(Union) → filtered candidate list**
   - For each product in the unified pool:
     - Investigate its **launch / first public release date** from credible public info
       (official site, launch post, Product Hunt / HN launch, blog, press, etc.).
     - Decide if it satisfies **both**:
       1) Launch date is within the last **14 days** (relative to “today”).
       2) Product is clearly related to **AI coding / code agents / IDE / dev workflows**.
   - If you cannot reasonably verify that the launch is within 14 days,
     **treat it as NOT valid** and exclude it.
   - Internally keep, for each surviving product:
     - `release_date` in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (best reasonable guess)
     - short one-line justification (do not put the justification in final YAML).

4. **Sort(filtered candidates) → final ordered list**
   - Only work with products that passed the filter.
   - Rank them by a simple mental score combining:
     - **recency** (more recent launch date is better),
     - **attention** (strong launch signal: PH upvotes, HN discussion, X/Reddit buzz),
     - **relevance** (how closely it fits “AI coding agent / IDE / devtool”).
   - You do not need to show the numeric score, just use it to order the list.


### Claude Code / todo-style planning requirements

When running inside Claude Code with access to a `todowrite` (or similar TODO-list) tool,
you MUST first externalize this plan as an explicit TODO list **before** doing any research.

Follow these rules:

0. Start with a planning item: add `Consider how to update todos based on products` as the very first TODO.

1. Based on the QUESTION list in the `user:` section, use the `todowrite` tool to create **one TODO item per QUESTION**.  
   - Each item should correspond to “Sources(QUESTION_i)” — i.e., collecting candidates for that QUESTION.

2. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Union** stage:  
   - e.g. “Union(all source results)” to merge candidates from all QUESTION-based source tasks.

3. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Filter** stage:  
   - e.g. “Filter(union) by launch date ≤ 14 days and AI coding relevance”.

4. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Sort** stage and final write-out:  
   - e.g. “Sort(filtered) and write result to result.yaml (or final-products.yaml)”.

A minimal example of the TODO list structure you are expected to build is (showing the alternating “record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” steps):

TODO List
- [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
...
- [ ] Union(sources from 1 to 3)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Write result to new-product.json
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

You may have more than 3 QUESTION-based source items (e.g. 7), but the pattern MUST be the same:
first all `Sources(QUESTION i)` items, then one `Union(...)`, one or more `Filter(...)` based on the number of unique products, one `Sort(...)`,
and finally one “write result” item.

You should use this TODO list as the execution plan and mark items as completed as you progress.

After all `Sources(QUESTION i)` tasks are done, you MUST rewrite the TODO list:
- Replace the generic filter items with one `Filter(<product name>)` per discovered product (the count of Filter items must equal the number of products).
- Keep `Sort(filtered)` and the final write step after those filter items.

Example refreshed TODO after finding 3 products:
TODO List
- [ ] Filter(Product Alpha)
- [ ] Filter(Product Beta)
- [ ] Filter(Product Gamma)
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Write result to result.yaml

**Progress logging pattern (few-shot)**
- After EVERY action item, add an explicit “Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” item (and mark it done once you rewrite and overwrite the file).
- This enforces a rhythm of: do a step → record progress → rewrite TODO → update `new-product.json` → next step.
- Sample pattern the model should mirror:
  - [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Union(all source results)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sort(filtered)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Write result to new-product.json
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

**Final output format (what you actually return):**

- Return a **JSON array** of products, sorted from most to least interesting.
- Each entry MUST have the following fields:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "name": "<product name>",
      "url": "<official homepage>",
      "description": "1–3 sentence summary of what this product does, focused on the developer / AI-coding use case.",
      "release_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "category": "<short label, e.g. \"AI IDE\", \"AI coding CLI\", \"code agent\", \"workflow agent\">",
      "sources": ["Product Hunt", "Show HN", "Reddit", "X"],
      "community_quotes": [
        "<short quote from community describing what people like or notice>",
        "<up to 5 quotes total, can be paraphrased but must reflect real feedback>"
      ]
    }
  ]
```

* Only include products that:

  * You have **good evidence** were launched in the last 14 days, and
  * Clearly belong to the **AI coding / developer tools** space.

* If you cannot find any products that satisfy the 14-day constraint,
  return an empty JSON array: `[]`.

Be concise, factual, and avoid marketing fluff. Do **not** include your reasoning text
in the final answer—only the JSON.

**File output + incremental updates requirement**
- Maintain a file named `new-product` in the current working directory.
- After every step (including each “Record progress, rewrite todo”), write the current JSON array to `new-product` (overwrite). Early steps may be partial/rough; later steps should be refined.
- The JSON must always be valid and reflect the best current view (start with `[]` if nothing yet).
- After the final step, ensure `new-product` holds the final sorted array.

## Working Directory Context

Your current working directory is: `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2025-12-27`

All file operations should be relative to this directory.

---

Below is your QUESTION list. For each QUESTION, treat it as a separate “research lens”
to discover newly launched AI coding products (global constraint: last 14 days).

1. QUESTION 1
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that position themselves as a “full AI IDE” (similar to Windsurf or Cursor), not just a small autocomplete plugin.

2. QUESTION 2
   List newly launched AI coding CLIs or terminal-based agents from the last 14 days that behave like Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, or Claude Code CLI (repo-aware, can run commands, can manage tasks).

3. QUESTION 5
   List newly launched AI tools from the last 14 days that focus on one specific developer workflow (for example debugging, refactoring, test generation, or migration) instead of being a general-purpose coding assistant.

4. QUESTION 7
   List newly launched AI code agents from the last 14 days that advertise “project-long memory” or “workspace memory” across multiple sessions (not just single-chat context).

5. QUESTION 11
   List newly launched open-source AI coding agents from the last 14 days that can be self-hosted or run locally by developers.

6. QUESTION 14
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that integrate directly into existing IDEs (such as VS Code, JetBrains, or Neovim) rather than being a standalone IDE.

7. QUESTION 16
   List newly launched AI agents from the last 14 days that help developers run or orchestrate complex workflows across tools (for example CI/CD, deployment, observability, or incident response), rather than only editing code.

[assistant message #2]
I'll help you research newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days. Let me start by creating a TODO list to organize this research systematically.

Let! I found that Gemini CLI was launched in June 2025, not December. Let me search more specifically for products released in the last 14 days (December 13-27, 2025). Let me update the file with what I've found so far and continue searching:

OpenAI GPT-5.2**\n- **Released:** December 11, 2025\n- **Details:** OpenAI launched GPT-5.2 as an advanced AI model with improved capabilities, particularly focused on professional tasks and coding. The model was released in multiple tiers: Instant, Thinking, and Pro, with Pro offering advanced reasoning for professional development work.\n- **Developer Impact:** This model includes enhanced autonomous coding capabilities, allowing it to code for extended periods.\n\n### **2. AI Developer Tool Rankings (December 2025)**\n- **Publication:** December 12, 2025\n- **Source:** LogRocket published comprehensive AI dev tool power rankings\n- **Top Tools Listed:**\n  - **Claude Sonnet 4.5** (ranked #2)\n  - **Gemini 2.5 Pro** (ranked #5)\n  - **Windsurf** (ranked #2)\n  - Other notable tools: Cursor, Aider, Zed, GitHub Copilot\n\n### **3. Anthropic Claude Updates**\n- While not a December-specific release, **Claude Opus 4.5** was released in November 2025, showing 50-75% reductions in tool calling errors and build/lint errors, making it highly relevant for developers going into December.\n\n## **Other Context:**\nDecember 2025 appears to have been a transitional month where many AI companies were positioning their tools for the end of year, with OpenAI's GPT-5.2 being the most significant December release specifically for developers and coding tasks. The focus throughout 2025 has been on making AI coding tools more production-ready rather than experimental, with better integration into development workflows.\n\nWould you like me to search for more specific information about any of these tools or their December 2025 releases?\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

AI Developer Tool Rankings (December 2025)**\n- **Publication:** December 12, 2025\n- **Source:** LogRocket published comprehensive AI dev tool power rankings\n- **Top Tools Listed:**\n  - **Claude Sonnet 4.5** (ranked #2)\n  - **Gemini 2.5 Pro** (ranked #5)\n  - **Windsurf** (ranked #2)\n  - Other notable tools: Cursor, Aider, Zed, GitHub Copilot\n\n### **3. Anthropic Claude Updates**\n- While not a December-specific release, **Claude Opus 4.5** was released in November 2025, showing 50-75% reductions in tool calling errors and build/lint errors, making it highly relevant for developers going into December.\n\n## **Other Context:**\nDecember 2025 appears to have been a transitional month where many AI companies were positioning their tools for the end of year, with OpenAI's GPT-5.2 being the most significant December release specifically for developers and coding tasks. The focus throughout 2025 has been on making AI coding tools more production-ready rather than experimental, with better integration into development workflows.\n\nWould you like me to search for more specific information about any of these tools or their December 2025 releases?"

Great! I found GPT-5.2 which was released December 11, 2025. However, that's a model, not a coding tool itself. Let me check OpenAI DevDay 2025 more closely and look for actual tools/products that launched:

Good! I found JetBrains ACP support released December 5, 2025, which is within the 14-day window (since today is December 27, 2025). However, ACP is a protocol, not a standalone product. Let me continue searching and also look for any other December releases. Let me update my progress:

Based on my extensive research, I've found that:

1. **Toad** (launched December 18, 2025) - This is within the 14-day window and is a valid product
2. **JetBrains ACP Support** (announced December 5, 2025) - This is 22 days ago, which is outside the 14-day window

Let me verify the date calculation and check if there are any other products:

However, there does not appear to be any specific announcement, release, or launch of ACP in **December 2025**. Here's what I found:\n\n## Key Findings:\n\n### Agent Client Protocol (ACP) - **Launched September 2025**\n- **Original Creator**: Zed Industries (creators of the Zed code editor)\n- **Launch Date**: **September 3, 2025** — ACP was officially announced and made available in Zed\n- **Purpose**: An open standard that allows any code editor or IDE to connect seamlessly to any AI agent (similar to how LSP works for programming languages)\n\n### Major Developments:\n1. **August 27, 2025** — Zed announced \"Bring Your Own Agent\" feature with Google's Gemini CLI as the first ACP-compatible agent\n2. **September 3, 2025** — Zed officially launched ACP and Claude Code integration in public beta\n3. **October 23, 2025** — JetBrains announced partnership with Zed to co-develop and adopt ACP\n4. **December 16-19, 2025** — JetBrains documentation updated with ACP support (but not a new announcement)\n\n### What ACP Does:\n- Standardizes communication between AI coding agents and IDEs/editors\n- Enables developers to use any AI agent (Claude, Gemini, etc.) in any ACP-compatible editor\n- Often called \"the LSP for AI agents\"\n\n## Conclusion:\n**No December 2025 ACP announcement was found.** The protocol was launched in September 2025 by Zed Industries, with subsequent adoption by JetBrains and other tools throughout October and November 2025. The December 2025 references in the search results appear to be documentation updates or general mentions, not new releases or announcements.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

The December 2025 references in the search results appear to be documentation updates or general mentions, not new releases or announcements."

The v0 Product Hunt page shows it was originally launched in 2023, with subsequent launches in October and August 2025 - not within our December 13-27 window.

Based on my comprehensive research, I've only found **one product** that was clearly launched within the 14-day window (December 13-27, 2025): **Toad** (December 18, 2025).

The JetBrains ACP support from December 5, 2025 is actually outside the 14-day window (it's 22 days ago).

Let me now update the file with just the verified product and complete the task:
