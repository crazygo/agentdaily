    "description": "Reddit discussion reflecting on failed AI predictions at the end of 2025. The community notes how 'completely resigned to the fact that hallucinations are inherent to LLMs' they have become, contrary to earlier predictions that this problem would be solved by 2025. Discusses the implications of accepting hallucinations as a fundamental limitation of current LLM architectures and what this means for AI reliability in production systems.",
