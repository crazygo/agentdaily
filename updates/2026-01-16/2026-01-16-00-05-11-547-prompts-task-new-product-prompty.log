[system]
You are an AI research analyst specialized in AI developer tools:
code agents, AI IDEs, AI coding CLIs, and related devtools.

Your **global goal**:
- Find genuinely new products that have been publicly launched in the **last 14 days**
- AND that clearly target **programming / code / AI dev workflows**
- THEN summarize only the valid ones in a **clean YAML list**.

You MUST treat the questions in the `user:` section as your **research QUESTION list**.
Each QUESTION is a different “angle” on the same market (e.g., full AI IDE, CLI, workflow-focused, etc.).

To organize your reasoning, use this formula:

> Answer = Sort( Filter( Union(Sources) ) )

You must conceptually follow these four stages:

1. **Sources → candidate list (per QUESTION)**
   - For each QUESTION from the `user:` section:
     - Search the web and relevant directories / launch pages.
     - Collect as many **candidate products** as are reasonably relevant.
   - For each candidate, internally track at least:
     - `name` (product name)
     - `url` (official homepage or primary landing page)
     - `description` (1–3 sentences in English summarizing what it does)
     - `sources` (which QUESTION(s) and which site(s) you saw it on)
   - At this stage you are allowed to over-collect; do **not** filter by date yet unless it is trivial.

2. **Union(candidates) → unified candidate set**
   - Merge candidates across all QUESTIONS into a single conceptual set:
     - Deduplicate products that clearly refer to the same thing
       (same URL, or obviously the same product name + branding).
   - After this step you have a unified **candidate pool**:
     - It may still contain old products, or products outside our domain.

3. **Filter(Union) → filtered candidate list**
   - For each product in the unified pool:
     - Investigate its **launch / first public release date** from credible public info
       (official site, launch post, Product Hunt / HN launch, blog, press, etc.).
     - Decide if it satisfies **both**:
       1) Launch date is within the last **14 days** (relative to “today”).
       2) Product is clearly related to **AI coding / code agents / IDE / dev workflows**.
   - If you cannot reasonably verify that the launch is within 14 days,
     **treat it as NOT valid** and exclude it.
   - Internally keep, for each surviving product:
     - `release_date` in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (best reasonable guess)
     - short one-line justification (do not put the justification in final YAML).

4. **Sort(filtered candidates) → final ordered list**
   - Only work with products that passed the filter.
   - Rank them by a simple mental score combining:
     - **recency** (more recent launch date is better),
     - **attention** (strong launch signal: PH upvotes, HN discussion, X/Reddit buzz),
     - **relevance** (how closely it fits “AI coding agent / IDE / devtool”).
   - You do not need to show the numeric score, just use it to order the list.


### Claude Code / todo-style planning requirements

When running inside Claude Code with access to a `todowrite` (or similar TODO-list) tool,
you MUST first externalize this plan as an explicit TODO list **before** doing any research.

Follow these rules:

0. Start with a planning item: add `Consider how to update todos based on products` as the very first TODO.

1. Based on the QUESTION list in the `user:` section, use the `todowrite` tool to create **one TODO item per QUESTION**.  
   - Each item should correspond to “Sources(QUESTION_i)” — i.e., collecting candidates for that QUESTION.

2. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Union** stage:  
   - e.g. “Union(all source results)” to merge candidates from all QUESTION-based source tasks.

3. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Filter** stage:  
   - e.g. “Filter(union) by launch date ≤ 14 days and AI coding relevance”.

4. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Sort** stage and final write-out:  
   - e.g. “Sort(filtered) and write result to result.yaml (or final-products.yaml)”.

A minimal example of the TODO list structure you are expected to build is (showing the alternating “record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” steps):

TODO List
- [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
...
- [ ] Union(sources from 1 to 3)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Write result to new-product.json
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

You may have more than 3 QUESTION-based source items (e.g. 7), but the pattern MUST be the same:
first all `Sources(QUESTION i)` items, then one `Union(...)`, one or more `Filter(...)` based on the number of unique products, one `Sort(...)`,
and finally one “write result” item.

You should use this TODO list as the execution plan and mark items as completed as you progress.

After all `Sources(QUESTION i)` tasks are done, you MUST rewrite the TODO list:
- Replace the generic filter items with one `Filter(<product name>)` per discovered product (the count of Filter items must equal the number of products).
- Keep `Sort(filtered)` and the final write step after those filter items.

Example refreshed TODO after finding 3 products:
TODO List
- [ ] Filter(Product Alpha)
- [ ] Filter(Product Beta)
- [ ] Filter(Product Gamma)
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Write result to result.yaml

**Progress logging pattern (few-shot)**
- After EVERY action item, add an explicit “Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” item (and mark it done once you rewrite and overwrite the file).
- This enforces a rhythm of: do a step → record progress → rewrite TODO → update `new-product.json` → next step.
- Sample pattern the model should mirror:
  - [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Union(all source results)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sort(filtered)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Write result to new-product.json
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

**Final output format (what you actually return):**

- Return a **JSON array** of products, sorted from most to least interesting.
- Each entry MUST have the following fields:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "name": "<product name>",
      "url": "<official homepage>",
      "description": "1–3 sentence summary of what this product does, focused on the developer / AI-coding use case.",
      "release_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "category": "<short label, e.g. \"AI IDE\", \"AI coding CLI\", \"code agent\", \"workflow agent\">",
      "sources": ["Product Hunt", "Show HN", "Reddit", "X"],
      "community_quotes": [
        "<short quote from community describing what people like or notice>",
        "<up to 5 quotes total, can be paraphrased but must reflect real feedback>"
      ]
    }
  ]
```

* Only include products that:

  * You have **good evidence** were launched in the last 14 days, and
  * Clearly belong to the **AI coding / developer tools** space.

* If you cannot find any products that satisfy the 14-day constraint,
  return an empty JSON array: `[]`.

Be concise, factual, and avoid marketing fluff. Do **not** include your reasoning text
in the final answer—only the JSON.

**File output + incremental updates requirement**
- Maintain a file named `new-product` in the current working directory.
- After every step (including each “Record progress, rewrite todo”), write the current JSON array to `new-product` (overwrite). Early steps may be partial/rough; later steps should be refined.
- The JSON must always be valid and reflect the best current view (start with `[]` if nothing yet).
- After the final step, ensure `new-product` holds the final sorted array.

## Working Directory Context

Your current working directory is: `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2026-01-16`

All file operations should be relative to this directory.

Below is your QUESTION list. For each QUESTION, treat it as a separate “research lens”
to discover newly launched AI coding products (global constraint: last 14 days).

1. QUESTION 1
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that position themselves as a “full AI IDE” (similar to Windsurf or Cursor), not just a small autocomplete plugin.

2. QUESTION 2
   List newly launched AI coding CLIs or terminal-based agents from the last 14 days that behave like Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, or Claude Code CLI (repo-aware, can run commands, can manage tasks).

3. QUESTION 5
   List newly launched AI tools from the last 14 days that focus on one specific developer workflow (for example debugging, refactoring, test generation, or migration) instead of being a general-purpose coding assistant.

4. QUESTION 7
   List newly launched AI code agents from the last 14 days that advertise “project-long memory” or “workspace memory” across multiple sessions (not just single-chat context).

5. QUESTION 11
   List newly launched open-source AI coding agents from the last 14 days that can be self-hosted or run locally by developers.

6. QUESTION 14
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that integrate directly into existing IDEs (such as VS Code, JetBrains, or Neovim) rather than being a standalone IDE.

7. QUESTION 16
   List newly launched AI agents from the last 14 days that help developers run or orchestrate complex workflows across tools (for example CI/CD, deployment, observability, or incident response), rather than only editing code.

[assistant message #2]
I'll help you research newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days. Let me start by creating a structured TODO list and then systematically investigate each question.

      "Based on my search results, I found several relevant articles discussing the Windsurf and Cursor competition in the AI coding space for 2026. Here's a summary of the key findings:\n\n## Key Findings:\n\n### **Windsurf and Cursor Competition**\n- Multiple sources from late 2025 and early 2026 indicate intense competition between Windsurf AI and Cursor\n- Both are positioned as top AI coding assistants, competing alongside other tools like GitHub Copilot, Bolt, v0, Replit, and others\n\n### **Market Context for 2026**\n- **Cursor** is described as having \"won the hearts of independent developers\" while maintaining a reported valuation of 10 billion yuan\n- **Windsurf** is highlighted for its deep codebase understanding and focus on speed, making it a strong contender for developers prioritizing efficiency\n- The competition is described as becoming increasingly intense, with features and configurations transferable between platforms\n\n### **Recent Developments**\n- As of January 2026, there are reports that xAI engineers were using competitor Anthropic's Claude model through Cursor for coding\n- Articles discuss how the AI coding landscape in 2026 is shifting from competing on model parameters to competing on developer retention and experience (\"who can make developers 'addicted'\")\n\n### **Notable Features**\n- **Cursor**: Features \"Composer mode\" - evolving from simple code completion to being able to \"take over\" entire projects like a junior engineer\n- **Windsurf**: Features \"Cascade\" mode with similar evolution toward more autonomous project handling\n\nWould you like me to search for more specific information about any particular aspect of this competition or the planned features for 2026?"

Good! I found information about several tools. Let me update the candidates and continue. I found updates to existing tools (Claude Code 2.1, Cline 3.48.0, Gemini CLI v0.23.0) but these are updates to existing products, not new launches within the last 14 days. Let me check if there are any truly new CLI launches.

Memory is project-specific, ensuring sensitive data stays contained within individual projects. Users can enable project-only memory when creating a project.\n\n### 2. **\"Ep 686: How to actually use ChatGPT in 2026\"** (January 7, 2026)\nThis recent episode covers the 7 rules for becoming a ChatGPT power user in 2026. Key points include:\n- ChatGPT is best for teams\n- Features include **project memory**, shared GPTs, and group chats\n- Focus on collaborative workflows\n\n### 3. **Claude Code Memory Architecture**\nMultiple sources discuss Claude's project memory implementation:\n- **Project Memory**: Uses `./CLAUDE.md` file in the project root directory\n- **User Memory**: Stored in user's home directory\n- **Team/Org Memory**: Organization-level policies and instructions\n\nThe three-tier architecture creates nested contexts, each serving distinct purposes in AI-assisted development.\n\n### 4. **Recent Industry Developments**\n- \"I Shipped AI Memory. Then Platforms Caught Up\" (published 3 weeks ago) discusses how project memory features are becoming standardized across AI platforms\n- Claude creates dedicated project memory and summaries for each workspace, focusing only on that project's conversations\n\n### 5. **Practical Implementation Guides**\nSources show that AI coding assistants now commonly use project memory through:\n- Standard files like `CLAUDE.md` for project-specific instructions\n- Project architecture documentation\n- Coding standards and common workflows\n- Team integration via source control\n\nThe search results indicate that **workspace and project memory have become mainstream features** in AI coding tools by January 2026, with major platforms like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Anthropic's Claude Code offering robust project-specific memory capabilities to enhance team collaboration and context retention.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

      "# Search Results: Workspace Memory, Project Memory, and AI Coding (January 2026)\n\n## Top Findings\n\n### 1. **ChatGPT Enterprise & Edu Release Notes** \nOpenAI has released project-only memory features for ChatGPT Enterprise and Education versions. Memory is project-specific, ensuring sensitive data stays contained within individual projects. Users can enable project-only memory when creating a project.\n\n### 2. **\"Ep 686: How to actually use ChatGPT in 2026\"** (January 7, 2026)\nThis recent episode covers the 7 rules for becoming a ChatGPT power user in 2026. Key points include:\n- ChatGPT is best for teams\n- Features include **project memory**, shared GPTs, and group chats\n- Focus on collaborative workflows\n\n### 3. **Claude Code Memory Architecture**\nMultiple sources discuss Claude's project memory implementation:\n- **Project Memory**: Uses `./CLAUDE.md` file in the project root directory\n- **User Memory**: Stored in user's home directory\n- **Team/Org Memory**: Organization-level policies and instructions\n\nThe three-tier architecture creates nested contexts, each serving distinct purposes in AI-assisted development.\n\n### 4. **Recent Industry Developments**\n- \"I Shipped AI Memory. Then Platforms Caught Up\" (published 3 weeks ago) discusses how project memory features are becoming standardized across AI platforms\n- Claude creates dedicated project memory and summaries for each workspace, focusing only on that project's conversations\n\n### 5. **Practical Implementation Guides**\nSources show that AI coding assistants now commonly use project memory through:\n- Standard files like `CLAUDE.md` for project-specific instructions\n- Project architecture documentation\n- Coding standards and common workflows\n- Team integration via source control\n\nThe search results indicate that **workspace and project memory have become mainstream features** in AI coding tools by January 2026, with major platforms like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Anthropic's Claude Code offering robust project-specific memory capabilities to enhance team collaboration and context retention."

I see - Cursor 2.0 was actually October 2025, not January 2026. But **Claude Cowork** is indeed a January 2026 launch (January 12-13). Let me update the candidates and move forward:

[assistant message #113]
All 3 candidates are within the last 14 days (Jan 2-16, 2026). Now let me filter them for relevance and sort them. All three are relevant to AI coding/developer tools:

1. **IQuest Coder V1** (Jan 2) - open-source AI coding model - HIGH relevance
2. **Claude Cowork** (Jan 12) - desktop AI agent for developers - MEDIUM relevance (general desktop but dev-focused)
3. **FetchCoder V2** (Jan 15) - AI coding agent for autonomous agents - HIGH relevance

Let me sort by relevance and recency, and finalize:
