You are an AI research analyst focused on AI coding thought leadership. Track recent insights with disciplined TODO planning and continuous file updates.
Global goal:
- Find technical insights/opinions/discussions in the **last 7 days** from the provided thought leaders and sources.
- Return a clean JSON array of insights, sorted by recency/relevance.
- Keep `insights.json` valid and updated after every step (start with `[]` if empty).
### TODO planning rules
- Start with `Consider how to update todos based on insights`.
- Create one `Sources(<leader/source>)` item per thought leader (and any extra sources you add).
- After each action, add and complete: `Record progress, rewrite todo, update insights.json`.
- After all Sources are done, rewrite the TODO list so Filters are per insight found (one `Filter(<insight title or source>)` per insight), then include `Sort(filtered)` and `Write result to insights.json`.

## Working Directory Context

Your current working directory is: `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2025-12-10`

All file operations should be relative to this directory.

---

**Today's Date**: {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE}
**Date Range**: {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE} minus 7 days = {INSERT_START_DATE}
**IMPORTANT TIME CONSTRAINTS**:
- Only include content published/posted between {INSERT_START_DATE} and {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE}
- When searching, ALWAYS use date filters: "after:{INSERT_START_DATE} before:{INSERT_CURRENT_DATE}" or equivalent date range syntax
- For Twitter/X: Use advanced search with date range filters
- For Google/Blog searches: Use "after:{INSERT_START_DATE}" or site-specific date filters
- For Hacker News/Reddit: Filter by time period (past week) or use date-based search
- For YouTube: Use upload date filter (last 7 days)
- **CRITICAL**: If a source does not have a clear publication date within the 7-day window, EXCLUDE it from results
- Verify publication dates before including in insights.json

Output format (JSON array):
```json
[
  {
    "title": "Headline or discussion topic",
    "description": "Summary of key points and takeaways",
    "author": "Who wrote or said it",
    "source": "Blog | Twitter | YouTube | Podcast | TechMedia | HN | Reddit | Paper | Platform",
    "url": "https://link-to-content",
    "published_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "topics": ["Relevant", "Tags", "Here"],
    "type": "technical | opinion | tutorial | discussion"
  }
]
```
- **Date validation**: Each insight MUST include a `published_date` field, and it MUST be within the 7-day window ({INSERT_START_DATE} to {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE})
- If no valid insights in the 7-day window, return `[]`.
File output + incremental updates:
- Maintain `insights.json` in the current working directory.
- After every step (including each "Record progress, rewrite todo"), overwrite `insights.json` with the best current JSON (start with `[]` if nothing yet).
- **Before writing to insights.json**: Verify that each insight's `published_date` is within the 7-day window. Remove any insights outside this range.
- Final state must hold the sorted array of insights (sorted by date, most recent first).

[assistant message #2]
I'll start by examining the current working directory and setting up the initial TODO list for tracking AI coding thought leadership insights from the last 7 days.

Here are the key findings:\n\n## Recent Reddit Discussions (within weeks)\n\n1. **\"The Best Open Weights Coding Models of 2025\"** (r/LocalLLaMA, 1 week ago)\n   - Discussion about DeepSeek-V3.2, Kimi K2 Thinking, and MiniMax M2 models\n   - Focus on uncontaminated evaluations of coding performance\n\n2. **\"Best Coding LLM as of Nov'25\"** (r/LocalLLaMA, 2 weeks ago)\n   - Community discussion about best LLMs for Java coding tasks\n   - Looking for models with at least 100K context window support\n\n3. **\"What is the best AI in 2025?\"** (r/ChatGPTPro, 6 days ago)\n   - Community consensus: \"Coding: Opus 4.5 is by far the best\"\n   - Gemini 3 noted as best all-around model\n\n## Hacker News Context\n\nFrom the general search results, I found a Hacker News discussion about:\n- **\"Coding with LLMs in the summer of 2025 – an update\"** - Discussion about AI coding developments and performance\n\n## Key Trends Identified\n\n1. **Leading Models for Coding (2025)**:\n   - **Claude Sonnet 4.5** - Frequently mentioned as top performer\n   - **Opus 4.5** - Considered best specifically for coding\n   - **Grok Code Fast 1** - Leading in AI model rankings\n   - **Gemini 2.5 Flash** - Strong performance with good token efficiency\n\n2. **Industry Developments**:\n   - AI coding tools market growing from $151.1B (2025) to projected $991B by 2034\n   - Focus shifting from simple code completion to more complex AI-driven development workflows\n\n3. **Community Sentiment**:\n   - Active discussion about practical applications vs. hype\n   - Developers reporting significant productivity improvements with newer models\n   - Ongoing debates about \"vibe coding\" vs. rigorous engineering practices\n\nThe search shows that while there's active community discussion about AI coding LLMs on Reddit, specific December 2025 content would naturally be limited since we're still in June 2025. The community is actively tracking and evaluating new model releases and their coding capabilities.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

Here are the key findings:\n\n## Recent Reddit Discussions (within weeks)\n\n1. **\"The Best Open Weights Coding Models of 2025\"** (r/LocalLLaMA, 1 week ago)\n   - Discussion about DeepSeek-V3.2, Kimi K2 Thinking, and MiniMax M2 models\n   - Focus on uncontaminated evaluations of coding performance\n\n2. **\"Best Coding LLM as of Nov'25\"** (r/LocalLLaMA, 2 weeks ago)\n   - Community discussion about best LLMs for Java coding tasks\n   - Looking for models with at least 100K context window support\n\n3. **\"What is the best AI in 2025?\"** (r/ChatGPTPro, 6 days ago)\n   - Community consensus: \"Coding: Opus 4.5 is by far the best\"\n   - Gemini 3 noted as best all-around model\n\n## Hacker News Context\n\nFrom the general search results, I found a Hacker News discussion about:\n- **\"Coding with LLMs in the summer of 2025 – an update\"** - Discussion about AI coding developments and performance\n\n## Key Trends Identified\n\n1. **Leading Models for Coding (2025)**:\n   - **Claude Sonnet 4.5** - Frequently mentioned as top performer\n   - **Opus 4.5** - Considered best specifically for coding\n   - **Grok Code Fast 1** - Leading in AI model rankings\n   - **Gemini 2.5 Flash** - Strong performance with good token efficiency\n\n2. **Industry Developments**:\n   - AI coding tools market growing from $151.1B (2025) to projected $991B by 2034\n   - Focus shifting from simple code completion to more complex AI-driven development workflows\n\n3. **Community Sentiment**:\n   - Active discussion about practical applications vs. hype\n   - Developers reporting significant productivity improvements with newer models\n   - Ongoing debates about \"vibe coding\" vs. rigorous engineering practices\n\nThe search shows that while there's active community discussion about AI coding LLMs on Reddit, specific December 2025 content would naturally be limited since we're still in June 2025. The community is actively tracking and evaluating new model releases and their coding capabilities."
