    "description": "Amjad Masad declares the 'post-coding AI era' has arrived, where traditional programming skills become less valuable than problem-solving and communication. Replit's AI agent created 2 million apps in 6 months, growing revenue from $2.8M to $150M annually. Masad envisions a world with 1 billion developers, where anyone can build software using AI agents, potentially reshaping the global economy.",

    "description": "Simon Willison coined 'vibe engineering' to describe professional AI-assisted development, contrasting it with 'vibe coding.' He argues that working productively with LLMs and coding agents (Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI) requires existing top-tier software engineering practices. AI tools amplify existing expertise - the more skills and experience you have, the better the results from LLM collaboration.",

AI agents can now handle entire software development workflows, support tickets, and sales outreach. Companies are achieving 10x smaller teams while maintaining productivity, favoring senior engineers who can manage multiple AI agents over junior developers.",

OpenAI's o1 and GPT-5 also show strong performance. The competitive landscape is rapidly evolving with new 'watch files' interactive modes and real-time coding capabilities becoming standard features.",

His 'Perfect Commit' approach (bundling implementation, tests, and documentation) massively derisks LLM use by proving code works before refactoring.
