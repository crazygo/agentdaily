You are an AI research analyst focused on AI coding thought leadership. Track recent insights with disciplined TODO planning and continuous file updates.
Global goal:
- Find technical insights/opinions/discussions in the **last 7 days** from the provided thought leaders and sources.
- Return a clean JSON array of insights, sorted by recency/relevance.
- Keep `insights.json` valid and updated after every step (start with `[]` if empty).
### TODO planning rules
- Start with `Consider how to update todos based on insights`.
- Create one `Sources(<leader/source>)` item per thought leader (and any extra sources you add).
- After each action, add and complete: `Record progress, rewrite todo, update insights.json`.
- After all Sources are done, rewrite the TODO list so Filters are per insight found (one `Filter(<insight title or source>)` per insight), then include `Sort(filtered)` and `Write result to insights.json`.

## Working Directory Context

Your current working directory is: `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2025-12-14`

All file operations should be relative to this directory.

---

**Today's Date**: {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE}
**Date Range**: {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE} minus 7 days = {INSERT_START_DATE}
**IMPORTANT TIME CONSTRAINTS**:
- Only include content published/posted between {INSERT_START_DATE} and {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE}
- When searching, ALWAYS use date filters: "after:{INSERT_START_DATE} before:{INSERT_CURRENT_DATE}" or equivalent date range syntax
- For Twitter/X: Use advanced search with date range filters
- For Google/Blog searches: Use "after:{INSERT_START_DATE}" or site-specific date filters
- For Hacker News/Reddit: Filter by time period (past week) or use date-based search
- For YouTube: Use upload date filter (last 7 days)
- **CRITICAL**: If a source does not have a clear publication date within the 7-day window, EXCLUDE it from results
- Verify publication dates before including in insights.json

Output format (JSON array):
```json
[
  {
    "title": "Headline or discussion topic",
    "description": "Summary of key points and takeaways",
    "author": "Who wrote or said it",
    "source": "Blog | Twitter | YouTube | Podcast | TechMedia | HN | Reddit | Paper | Platform",
    "url": "https://link-to-content",
    "published_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "topics": ["Relevant", "Tags", "Here"],
    "type": "technical | opinion | tutorial | discussion"
  }
]
```
- **Date validation**: Each insight MUST include a `published_date` field, and it MUST be within the 7-day window ({INSERT_START_DATE} to {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE})
- If no valid insights in the 7-day window, return `[]`.
File output + incremental updates:
- Maintain `insights.json` in the current working directory.
- After every step (including each "Record progress, rewrite todo"), overwrite `insights.json` with the best current JSON (start with `[]` if nothing yet).
- **Before writing to insights.json**: Verify that each insight's `published_date` is within the 7-day window. Remove any insights outside this range.
- Final state must hold the sorted array of insights (sorted by date, most recent first).

[assistant message #2]
I'll start by analyzing the current state and creating a TODO plan to track AI coding thought leadership insights from the last 7 days. Let me first check the current insights.json file and then begin systematic research.

[assistant message #10]
Looking at the current insights, I can see that only a few entries are within our target date range (December 7-13, 2025):
- "Google Partners with Replit" (2025-12-04) - slightly outside our range
- "NVIDIA ComputeEval 2025" (2025-12-10) - valid
- "AI-Designed Chips Challenge Human Understanding" (2025-12-10) - valid  
- "AI Agents as Universal Task Solvers" (2025-12-01) - slightly outside our range

Let me start with systematic research for the December 7-13, 2025 timeframe. I'll begin with Andrej Karpathy.

Here are the key findings:\n\n## Andrej Karpathy's Presence on X.com:\n- His official X handle is [@karpathy](https://x.com/karpathy)\n- Bio: \"Previously Director of AI @ Tesla, founding team @ OpenAI, CS231n/PhD @ Stanford. I like to train large deep neural nets.\"\n\n## Recent Karpathy Content on AI/LLM Coding (2025):\n\n### Notable Tweet Found:\nOne tweet from Karpathy states: *\"It's 2025 and most content is still written for humans instead of LLMs. 99.9% of attention is about to be LLM attention, not human attention.\"*\n\n### Related 2025 AI Coding Discussions:\n1. **\"Vibe Coding\" Term**: Karpathy recently coined the term \"vibe coding\" to describe a certain approach to programming with LLMs\n2. **LLM Code Generation Statistics**: For the Winter 2025 batch, 95% of lines of code were LLM-generated for 25% of developers\n3. **2025 AI State**: Karpathy discussed the evolution of software into three phases:\n   - Software 1.0 (traditional code)\n   - Software 2.0 (neural net weights) \n   - Current phase (natural-language driven development)\n\n### Technical Projects:\n- His GitHub repository [llm.c](https://github.com/karpathy/llm.c) focuses on LLM training in simple C/CUDA without heavy frameworks\n\nThe search didn't return any results with the specific date pattern \"2025-12-0\" - this might be an incomplete date specification or the content may not exist or isn't indexed yet."

The conversation is summarized below:\nAnalysis:\nLooking at this conversation chronologically:\n\n1. The user provided a comprehensive context prompt for tracking AI coding thought leadership insights from December 7-13, 2025, with specific requirements for date filtering and JSON output format.\n\n2. I was given a working directory and instructions to search various sources (thought leaders, YouTube channels, podcasts, tech media, technical platforms, community forums) for insights within the specified 7-day window.\n\n3. I started by reading the existing insights.json file to understand the current state and identify valid entries within the target date range.\n\n4. I created a TODO list to systematically track progress through different sources.\n\n5. I began searching for content from thought leaders:\n   - Searched for Andrej Karpathy's recent Twitter activity but didn't find specific content from Dec 7-13, 2025\n   - Found Simon Willison's blog posts from the target date range and successfully extracted 3 key insights\n\n6. I used the webReader tool to read specific blog posts and then updated the insights.json file with the new valid entries, filtering out content outside the target date range.\n\nKey technical details include:\n- Working directory: /home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2025-12-14\n- Target date range: December 7-13, 2025\n- JSON output format with specific fields (title, description, author, source, url, published_date, topics, type)\n- Date filtering requirements to ensure only content from the 7-day window is included\n\nThe user has not provided any explicit feedback or corrections to my approach so far.\n\nSummary:\n1. Primary Request and Intent:\n   The user requested comprehensive tracking of AI coding thought leadership insights from the last 7 days (December 7-13, 2025). The task involves searching multiple sources (individual thought leaders, YouTube channels, podcasts, tech media, technical platforms, and community forums) for content related to AI coding, LLMs, and developer tools. All insights must be filtered to include only content published within the specified 7-day window and formatted as JSON entries in a structured array with specific fields.\n\n2. Key Technical Concepts:\n   - AI coding and developer tools\n   - Large Language Models (LLMs)\n   - Date-filtered content aggregation (Dec 7-13, 2025)\n   - JSON data structure with specific schema\n   - Thought leadership tracking across multiple platforms\n   - Context engineering and vibe coding concepts\n   - AI benchmarks (SWE-bench, ComputeEval)\n   - Open models and licensing\n\n3. Files and Code Sections:\n   - /home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2025-12-14/insights.json\n     - This is the primary output file for storing insights\n     - Initially contained 10 entries, mostly outside the target date range\n     - Updated with 5 valid entries from Dec 7-13, 2025 timeframe\n     - Final JSON structure includes entries about LLM 0.28, OpenAI Skills, Devstral 2, NVIDIA ComputeEval, and AI-designed chips\n\n4. Errors and fixes:\n   - No technical errors encountered during execution\n   - Search results for Andrej Karpathy didn't yield content from the exact target date range, but this was expected due to the specific time window\n   - Successfully adapted search strategy to focus on sources with available content in the target timeframe\n\n5. Problem Solving:\n   - Successfully identified that only a few existing insights were within the target date range\n   - Implemented systematic approach using TODO list to track progress across multiple sources\n   - Used webReader tool to extract detailed content from specific URLs\n   - Applied strict date filtering to ensure compliance with 7-day window requirement\n\n6. All user messages:\n   - Initial comprehensive context prompt providing detailed instructions for tracking AI coding thought leadership insights with specific date ranges, sources to monitor, search strategies, and output format requirements\n\n7. Pending Tasks:\n   - Continue systematic search of remaining sources: Amjad Masad, Lex Fridman Podcast, YouTube channels (Two Minute Papers, Fireship, AI Explained), podcasts (The Changelog, Software Engineering Daily, AI Podcast), tech media (TechCrunch, The Verge, MIT Technology Review), technical platforms (Papers with Code, ArXiv, Towards Data Science), and community platforms (Hacker News, Reddit)\n\n8. Current Work:\n   I was in the process of systematically searching AI coding thought leadership content from December 7-13, 2025. I had completed searching Simon Willison's blog and successfully extracted 3 relevant insights, updating the insights.json file with valid entries. The file now contains 5 total entries within the target date range. I was using a TODO list to track progress and had marked the Simon Willison search as completed, with multiple other sources still pending.\n\n9. Optional Next Step:\n   Continue with the systematic search by moving to the next source in the TODO list: \"Sources(Amjad Masad) - search for AI coding/developer tools insights from Dec 7-13, 2025\" to maintain the comprehensive coverage across all specified thought leaders and platforms..\nPlease continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on."

This is a great find! This LinkedIn post from Amjad Masad is from 4 months ago (which would be around August 2025), but it contains valuable insights about AI coding productivity paradox. However, this is outside our target date range of December 7-13, 2025. Let me search for more recent content from Amjad Masad specifically from December 2025.

YouTube content cannot be published in future dates.\n\n## What the search revealed:\n\n1. **Channel Information**: \n   - Two Minute Papers focuses on explaining AI research papers and deep learning concepts\n   - Fireship provides high-intensity code tutorials and tech news\n   - AI Explained covers AI topics with detailed explanations\n\n2. **Recent Related Content**: The searches found general information about these channels and some AI-related content, but none matching your specific date criteria.\n\n## Recommendation:\n\nIf you're looking for recent AI coding content from these creators, I'd suggest:\n- Adjusting your search to **December 2024** (current year)\n- Removing the future date filter\n- Searching for \"AI coding\" or \"programming\" videos from these channels in the past few months\n\nWould you like me to perform a new search with corrected dates to find the most recent AI coding content from these channels?\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

[assistant message #101]
I see the issue - we're searching for December 2025 content but we're currently in December 2024. Since the target date range is December 7-13, 2025, and we haven't reached that date yet, there won't be any content from that timeframe. Let me adjust my search to look for the most recent content from these channels and document this appropriately.

Since we're looking for December 2025 content and that's in the future, I won't find specific episodes from that timeframe. Let me search for the most recent AI-related episodes from these podcasts to understand their current content and then move to the next sources.

[assistant message #151]
I notice there's a potential duplicate entry. Both entry #3 (Simon Willison's blog) and entry #8 (TechCrunch) mention Mistral's Devstral 2, but from different perspectives. Let me check if these are truly duplicates or complementary insights by examining their content more closely. Looking at the dates and details, they appear to be different angles on the same announcement. Let me update the TODO list and complete the filtering process.
