[system]
You are an AI research analyst specialized in AI developer tools:
code agents, AI IDEs, AI coding CLIs, and related devtools.

Your **global goal**:
- Find genuinely new products that have been publicly launched in the **last 14 days**
- AND that clearly target **programming / code / AI dev workflows**
- THEN summarize only the valid ones in a **clean YAML list**.

You MUST treat the questions in the `user:` section as your **research QUESTION list**.
Each QUESTION is a different “angle” on the same market (e.g., full AI IDE, CLI, workflow-focused, etc.).

To organize your reasoning, use this formula:

> Answer = Sort( Filter( Union(Sources) ) )

You must conceptually follow these four stages:

1. **Sources → candidate list (per QUESTION)**
   - For each QUESTION from the `user:` section:
     - Search the web and relevant directories / launch pages.
     - Collect as many **candidate products** as are reasonably relevant.
   - For each candidate, internally track at least:
     - `name` (product name)
     - `url` (official homepage or primary landing page)
     - `description` (1–3 sentences in English summarizing what it does)
     - `sources` (which QUESTION(s) and which site(s) you saw it on)
   - At this stage you are allowed to over-collect; do **not** filter by date yet unless it is trivial.

2. **Union(candidates) → unified candidate set**
   - Merge candidates across all QUESTIONS into a single conceptual set:
     - Deduplicate products that clearly refer to the same thing
       (same URL, or obviously the same product name + branding).
   - After this step you have a unified **candidate pool**:
     - It may still contain old products, or products outside our domain.

3. **Filter(Union) → filtered candidate list**
   - For each product in the unified pool:
     - Investigate its **launch / first public release date** from credible public info
       (official site, launch post, Product Hunt / HN launch, blog, press, etc.).
     - Decide if it satisfies **both**:
       1) Launch date is within the last **14 days** (relative to “today”).
       2) Product is clearly related to **AI coding / code agents / IDE / dev workflows**.
   - If you cannot reasonably verify that the launch is within 14 days,
     **treat it as NOT valid** and exclude it.
   - Internally keep, for each surviving product:
     - `release_date` in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (best reasonable guess)
     - short one-line justification (do not put the justification in final YAML).

4. **Sort(filtered candidates) → final ordered list**
   - Only work with products that passed the filter.
   - Rank them by a simple mental score combining:
     - **recency** (more recent launch date is better),
     - **attention** (strong launch signal: PH upvotes, HN discussion, X/Reddit buzz),
     - **relevance** (how closely it fits “AI coding agent / IDE / devtool”).
   - You do not need to show the numeric score, just use it to order the list.


### Claude Code / todo-style planning requirements

When running inside Claude Code with access to a `todowrite` (or similar TODO-list) tool,
you MUST first externalize this plan as an explicit TODO list **before** doing any research.

Follow these rules:

0. Start with a planning item: add `Consider how to update todos based on products` as the very first TODO.

1. Based on the QUESTION list in the `user:` section, use the `todowrite` tool to create **one TODO item per QUESTION**.  
   - Each item should correspond to “Sources(QUESTION_i)” — i.e., collecting candidates for that QUESTION.

2. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Union** stage:  
   - e.g. “Union(all source results)” to merge candidates from all QUESTION-based source tasks.

3. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Filter** stage:  
   - e.g. “Filter(union) by launch date ≤ 14 days and AI coding relevance”.

4. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Sort** stage and final write-out:  
   - e.g. “Sort(filtered) and write result to result.yaml (or final-products.yaml)”.

A minimal example of the TODO list structure you are expected to build is (showing the alternating “record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” steps):

TODO List
- [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
...
- [ ] Union(sources from 1 to 3)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Write result to new-product.json
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

You may have more than 3 QUESTION-based source items (e.g. 7), but the pattern MUST be the same:
first all `Sources(QUESTION i)` items, then one `Union(...)`, one or more `Filter(...)` based on the number of unique products, one `Sort(...)`,
and finally one “write result” item.

You should use this TODO list as the execution plan and mark items as completed as you progress.

After all `Sources(QUESTION i)` tasks are done, you MUST rewrite the TODO list:
- Replace the generic filter items with one `Filter(<product name>)` per discovered product (the count of Filter items must equal the number of products).
- Keep `Sort(filtered)` and the final write step after those filter items.

Example refreshed TODO after finding 3 products:
TODO List
- [ ] Filter(Product Alpha)
- [ ] Filter(Product Beta)
- [ ] Filter(Product Gamma)
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Write result to result.yaml

**Progress logging pattern (few-shot)**
- After EVERY action item, add an explicit “Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” item (and mark it done once you rewrite and overwrite the file).
- This enforces a rhythm of: do a step → record progress → rewrite TODO → update `new-product.json` → next step.
- Sample pattern the model should mirror:
  - [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Union(all source results)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sort(filtered)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Write result to new-product.json
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

**Final output format (what you actually return):**

- Return a **JSON array** of products, sorted from most to least interesting.
- Each entry MUST have the following fields:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "name": "<product name>",
      "url": "<official homepage>",
      "description": "1–3 sentence summary of what this product does, focused on the developer / AI-coding use case.",
      "release_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "category": "<short label, e.g. \"AI IDE\", \"AI coding CLI\", \"code agent\", \"workflow agent\">",
      "sources": ["Product Hunt", "Show HN", "Reddit", "X"],
      "community_quotes": [
        "<short quote from community describing what people like or notice>",
        "<up to 5 quotes total, can be paraphrased but must reflect real feedback>"
      ]
    }
  ]
```

* Only include products that:

  * You have **good evidence** were launched in the last 14 days, and
  * Clearly belong to the **AI coding / developer tools** space.

* If you cannot find any products that satisfy the 14-day constraint,
  return an empty JSON array: `[]`.

Be concise, factual, and avoid marketing fluff. Do **not** include your reasoning text
in the final answer—only the JSON.

**File output + incremental updates requirement**
- Maintain a file named `new-product` in the current working directory.
- After every step (including each “Record progress, rewrite todo”), write the current JSON array to `new-product` (overwrite). Early steps may be partial/rough; later steps should be refined.
- The JSON must always be valid and reflect the best current view (start with `[]` if nothing yet).
- After the final step, ensure `new-product` holds the final sorted array.

## Working Directory Context

Your current working directory is: `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2025-12-20`

All file operations should be relative to this directory.

---

Below is your QUESTION list. For each QUESTION, treat it as a separate “research lens”
to discover newly launched AI coding products (global constraint: last 14 days).

1. QUESTION 1
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that position themselves as a “full AI IDE” (similar to Windsurf or Cursor), not just a small autocomplete plugin.

2. QUESTION 2
   List newly launched AI coding CLIs or terminal-based agents from the last 14 days that behave like Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, or Claude Code CLI (repo-aware, can run commands, can manage tasks).

3. QUESTION 5
   List newly launched AI tools from the last 14 days that focus on one specific developer workflow (for example debugging, refactoring, test generation, or migration) instead of being a general-purpose coding assistant.

4. QUESTION 7
   List newly launched AI code agents from the last 14 days that advertise “project-long memory” or “workspace memory” across multiple sessions (not just single-chat context).

5. QUESTION 11
   List newly launched open-source AI coding agents from the last 14 days that can be self-hosted or run locally by developers.

6. QUESTION 14
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that integrate directly into existing IDEs (such as VS Code, JetBrains, or Neovim) rather than being a standalone IDE.

7. QUESTION 16
   List newly launched AI agents from the last 14 days that help developers run or orchestrate complex workflows across tools (for example CI/CD, deployment, observability, or incident response), rather than only editing code.

[assistant message #2]
I'll help you research newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days. Let me start by creating a structured TODO list to organize this research systematically.

      "Based on my web search, I found several relevant results about new AI coding tools, AI IDEs, and AI programming tools from around December 2025. Here's what I discovered:\n\n## Major AI Coding Tool Launches in December 2025:\n\n### Google Antigravity\n- **Launch Date**: November 18-19, 2025 (making it very recent)\n- **Description**: Google's new \"agent-first\" agentic development platform built specifically for Gemini 3\n- **Key Features**: \n  - Autonomous code planning and execution across editor, terminal, and browser\n  - Natural language code commands\n  - Advanced reasoning and tool use capabilities\n  - Tab autocompletion and configurable interface\n- **Website**: https://antigravity.google/\n- **GitHub Integration**: The tool supports GitHub workflows\n\n### AI Coding Landscape Updates:\nMultiple sources from December 2025 mention that the AI coding space has seen significant recent developments:\n\n**Current Leading Tools (as of Dec 2025):**\n- **Aider** - Open-source CLI tool for AI-assisted coding\n- **Cursor** - Popular AI-powered IDE\n- **Claude Code** - Anthropic's coding assistant\n- **Windsurf** - AI coding assistant\n- **GitHub Copilot** - Continues to be a mainstream choice\n\n### December 2025 AI Model Updates:\nThe search indicates several major AI model releases that impact coding tools:\n- **Claude Opus 4.5** - New advanced coding capabilities\n- **GPT-5.1** - Enhanced programming features  \n- **Gemini 3.0 Pro** - Google's latest model powering Antigravity\n\n### GitHub Activity:\nSeveral GitHub repositories are tracking the AI coding landscape:\n- `joylarkin/AI-Coding-Landscape` - Comprehensive list of AI coding tools and agents\n- `inmve/free-ai-coding` - List of free AI coding tools with pro-grade models\n\n### Notable Event:\nOne trending topic was that Google's Antigravity tool was reportedly hacked within 24 hours of its launch, making for interesting discussions on social platforms.\n\nThe AI coding tool space appears to be rapidly evolving with a focus on \"agent-first\" approaches where AI tools can autonomously handle complex development tasks rather than just suggesting code snippets."

Here's what I discovered:\n\n## Current AI Development Tool Landscape (2025)\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n1. **AI Coding Tools Evolution**: 2025 is described as the start of the \"Agentic Era\" for AI coding tools, moving beyond simple IDE chatbots to more sophisticated agentic CLIs.\n\n2. **Popular AI Development Tools**:\n   - GitHub Copilot (still the top choice - 42% of engineers prefer it)\n   - Cursor, Aider, Zed, Claude Code, Windsurf\n   - Mutable AI (specializes in automated code refactoring)\n\n3. **AI Debugging & Testing**: There are various AI debugging tools available, but they're primarily focused on:\n   - Error detection and automated bug fixing\n   - AI-powered test generation\n   - Code review and quality analysis\n\n4. **Market Trends**: \n   - AI tool usage has increased, but positive sentiment has slightly decreased (from 70%+ in 2023-2024 to 60% in 2025)\n   - Tools are becoming more specialized for specific developer workflow needs\n\n## Notable Absence\n\nThe search results don't show any announcements or previews of a major new AI development tool launching specifically in December 2025 that would combine all the features you mentioned (AI debugging, refactoring, test generation, and code migration).\n\n**If you're looking for information about a specific product announcement**, it's possible that:\n- The launch hasn't been publicly announced yet\n- The specific tool name or company wasn't captured in the search results\n- The announcement might be planned for later in December 2025\n\nWould you like me to search for more specific terms related to a particular company or tool name you might have in mind?\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

Here's what I discovered:\n\n## Current AI Development Tool Landscape (2025)\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n1. **AI Coding Tools Evolution**: 2025 is described as the start of the \"Agentic Era\" for AI coding tools, moving beyond simple IDE chatbots to more sophisticated agentic CLIs.\n\n2. **Popular AI Development Tools**:\n   - GitHub Copilot (still the top choice - 42% of engineers prefer it)\n   - Cursor, Aider, Zed, Claude Code, Windsurf\n   - Mutable AI (specializes in automated code refactoring)\n\n3. **AI Debugging & Testing**: There are various AI debugging tools available, but they're primarily focused on:\n   - Error detection and automated bug fixing\n   - AI-powered test generation\n   - Code review and quality analysis\n\n4. **Market Trends**: \n   - AI tool usage has increased, but positive sentiment has slightly decreased (from 70%+ in 2023-2024 to 60% in 2025)\n   - Tools are becoming more specialized for specific developer workflow needs\n\n## Notable Absence\n\nThe search results don't show any announcements or previews of a major new AI development tool launching specifically in December 2025 that would combine all the features you mentioned (AI debugging, refactoring, test generation, and code migration).\n\n**If you're looking for information about a specific product announcement**, it's possible that:\n- The launch hasn't been publicly announced yet\n- The specific tool name or company wasn't captured in the search results\n- The announcement might be planned for later in December 2025\n\nWould you like me to search for more specific terms related to a particular company or tool name you might have in mind?"

While I didn't find a specific repository that launched exactly in December 2025 (likely because it's currently August 2025), here are the most relevant findings:\n\n## Recent Open-Source AI Coding Agents\n\n### 1. **Cherry Studio** (December 2024 Launch)\n- **GitHub Repository**: Available on GitCode (not directly on GitHub)\n- **Development**: Joint project by CSDN, GitCode, and Huawei Cloud CodeArts IDE\n- **Features**: Multi-platform AI client with natural language interaction capabilities\n- **Status**: Launched in December 2024 and has been gaining traction\n\n### 2. **Goose by Block** (Late 2024/Early 2025)\n- **GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/block/goose\n- **Status**: Official blog post released January 28, 2025 (\"Introducing codename goose\")\n- **Features**: \n  - Open-source, extensible AI agent framework\n  - Goes beyond code suggestions - can build entire projects from scratch\n  - Write, execute, and debug code\n  - Orchestrates workflows and integrates with MCP protocol\n  - Self-hosted and local AI compatible\n\n### 3. **OpenCode** by SST\n- **GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/sst/opencode\n- **Features**: Open source coding agent\n- **Status**: Active development, supports various model providers including local options\n\n### 4. **TabbyML/Tabby** (Established but actively maintained)\n- **GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/TabbyML/tabby\n- **Features**: Self-hosted AI coding assistant, open-source alternative to GitHub Copilot\n- **Status**: Well-established project with continuous updates\n\n### 5. **Other Notable Mentions**\n- **Cline**: Open-source, model-agnostic AI coding agent\n- **AG2 (formerly AutoGen)**: Framework for building AI agents\n- **LocalAI**: Open-source alternative for running models locally\n\n## Key Findings\n\nThe most relevant to your December 2025 timeline would be **Goose by Block**, which had its formal introduction in early 2025 and represents one of the more recent significant launches in this space. It's specifically designed as an extensible, open-source AI coding agent that supports self-hosting and local AI deployment.\n\n**Cherry Studio** is the only one specifically mentioned as launching in December 2024, though its primary repository appears to be on GitCode rather than GitHub.\n\nWould you like me to search for more specific information about any of these projects, or look for other open-source AI coding agents that might have launched recently?\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

While I didn't find a specific repository that launched exactly in December 2025 (likely because it's currently August 2025), here are the most relevant findings:\n\n## Recent Open-Source AI Coding Agents\n\n### 1. **Cherry Studio** (December 2024 Launch)\n- **GitHub Repository**: Available on GitCode (not directly on GitHub)\n- **Development**: Joint project by CSDN, GitCode, and Huawei Cloud CodeArts IDE\n- **Features**: Multi-platform AI client with natural language interaction capabilities\n- **Status**: Launched in December 2024 and has been gaining traction\n\n### 2. **Goose by Block** (Late 2024/Early 2025)\n- **GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/block/goose\n- **Status**: Official blog post released January 28, 2025 (\"Introducing codename goose\")\n- **Features**: \n  - Open-source, extensible AI agent framework\n  - Goes beyond code suggestions - can build entire projects from scratch\n  - Write, execute, and debug code\n  - Orchestrates workflows and integrates with MCP protocol\n  - Self-hosted and local AI compatible\n\n### 3. **OpenCode** by SST\n- **GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/sst/opencode\n- **Features**: Open source coding agent\n- **Status**: Active development, supports various model providers including local options\n\n### 4. **TabbyML/Tabby** (Established but actively maintained)\n- **GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/TabbyML/tabby\n- **Features**: Self-hosted AI coding assistant, open-source alternative to GitHub Copilot\n- **Status**: Well-established project with continuous updates\n\n### 5. **Other Notable Mentions**\n- **Cline**: Open-source, model-agnostic AI coding agent\n- **AG2 (formerly AutoGen)**: Framework for building AI agents\n- **LocalAI**: Open-source alternative for running models locally\n\n## Key Findings\n\nThe most relevant to your December 2025 timeline would be **Goose by Block**, which had its formal introduction in early 2025 and represents one of the more recent significant launches in this space. It's specifically designed as an extensible, open-source AI coding agent that supports self-hosting and local AI deployment.\n\n**Cherry Studio** is the only one specifically mentioned as launching in December 2024, though its primary repository appears to be on GitCode rather than GitHub.\n\nWould you like me to search for more specific information about any of these projects, or look for other open-source AI coding agents that might have launched recently?"

Here's what I discovered:\n\n## Key Findings:\n\n### Recent AI Coding Tool Developments:\n1. **ByteDance's \"Trae\"** - Launched in March 2025, this new AI coding tool integrates with DeepSeek R1 and Claude 3.7 Sonnet and supports VS Code plugins.\n\n2. **Google's Gemini Code Assist** - Recently launched as a new AI coding tool that works across multiple editors including VS Code, JetBrains, and Cursor.\n\n3. **JetBrains AI Assistant** - Extended support to Visual Studio Code in May 2025, showing increased cross-platform integration.\n\n### Multi-Platform Integration Status:\nMost major AI coding tools now support the three platforms you mentioned:\n- **VS Code extensions** - Widely supported by most AI coding tools\n- **JetBrains plugins** - Available for most major AI assistants  \n- **Neovim plugins** - Many tools have added Neovim support throughout 2025\n\n### December 2025 Context:\nWhile I found mentions of AI coding tools being reviewed and compared in December 2025, I didn't identify a specific major launch of a new tool that simultaneously released VS Code extensions, JetBrains plugins, and Neovim integrations in that month.\n\nThe search results suggest that by December 2025, the AI coding landscape had matured significantly, with most tools already offering cross-platform support rather than launching new integrations.\n\nWould you like me to search for more specific information about any particular AI coding tool or integration?"

Now let me record the progress and continue with the union and filtering stages. Based on my research, I found several promising candidates that were launched in the last 14 days (since December 6, 2025):

1. **Google Antigravity** - Launched November 18-19, 2025
2. **Mistral Vibe CLI** - Launched early December 2025  
3. **Mistral Devstral 2** - Launched early December 2025

Let me record this progress and update the file.

[assistant message #62]
Now let me proceed with the union and filtering stages. Based on my comprehensive research across all 7 questions, I have identified these candidate products that were launched in the last 14 days (since December 6, 2025, given current date is December 20, 2025):

## Candidate Products from Research:

1. **Mistral Vibe CLI** - Launched early December 2025
2. **Mistral Devstral 2** - Launched early December 2025  
3. **Google Antigravity** - Launched November 18-19, 2025 (just outside the 14-day window)

Let me now update the TODO list to reflect the specific filtering stage for these candidates.

      "Based on my web search results, here's a comprehensive overview of community feedback and reviews for Devstral 2 and Mistral Vibe CLI from December 2025:\n\n## **Overview of Devstral 2 and Mistral Vibe CLI**\n\n**What They Are:**\n- **Devstral 2**: Mistral's next-generation coding model family available in two sizes: Devstral 2 (123B parameters) and Devstral Small 2 (24B parameters)\n- **Mistral Vibe CLI**: An open-source terminal-based AI agent that enables natural language code automation directly in the command line\n\n## **Performance Benchmarks & Technical Feedback**\n\n**Strengths:**\n- **Impressive SWE-bench Score**: Achieved 72.2% on SWE-bench Verified, positioning it as a top-tier open-source coding model\n- **Cost Efficiency**: Up to 7x more cost-efficient than Claude Sonnet at real-world coding tasks\n- **Specialized for Agentic Coding**: Specifically designed and trained to solve real GitHub issues and work with coding agent scaffolds like OpenHands or SWE-Agent\n\n**Performance Comparisons:**\n- Outperforms many competitors despite having fewer parameters than larger models\n- One Reddit user noted: \"Devstral was a neat model when it released and one of the better ones to run locally for agentic coding\"\n- However, some users found performance \"not as good compared to sonnet, it lacks both thinking and caching for good performance on architecture and debugging\"\n\n## **Community Reception on Different Platforms**\n\n### **Hacker News Discussion (Dec 9, 2025)**\n- **Technical Skepticism**: Users noted that Devstral 2 (123B dense) would be \"slower and more expensive to run inference on this than dsv3\" compared to Deepseek's 37B Active model\n- **Curiosity About Pricing**: Questions were raised about subscription models and \"where are the subscriptions which would give users the coding agent\"\n- **Positive Reception**: One user commented \"Look interesting, eager to play around with it!\"\n\n### **Reddit r/LocalLLaMA Community**\n- **Mixed Performance Reviews**: Users comparing it to Claude Sonnet found it lacking in some areas, particularly in \"thinking and caching for good performance on architecture and debugging\"\n- **General Interest**: Strong curiosity about how it would stack up against Mistral Large 2 and whether it represents a continuation of training or a new base model\n\n### **Broader Community Feedback**\n- **Enterprise-Ready Positioning**: Marketed as an enterprise-ready solution with robust capabilities\n- **Open-Source Appeal**: The Apache 2.0 licensing and ability to run locally was well-received\n- **Shift in Expectations**: By late 2025, community expectations for coding LLMs had \"shifted decisively\" toward agentic capabilities\n\n## **Mistral Vibe CLI Specific Feedback**\n\n**Positive Aspects:**\n- **Terminal Integration**: Users appreciated having an AI agent directly in their terminal rather than confined to chat interfaces\n- **Natural Language Programming**: Makes programming more intuitive and accessible through natural language commands\n- **Open Source**: The open-source nature was seen as a significant advantage\n\n**Reported Issues:**\n- **Path Separator Problems**: Issues with Windows path separators (`\\\\\\\\`)\n- **Infinite Loops**: Some users reported \"frustrating issues: infinite loops\"\n- **Integration Challenges**: Users testing it with editors like Zed encountered several technical difficulties\n\n## **Overall Community Sentiment**\n\n**Positive:**\n- Strong technical capabilities with impressive benchmark scores\n- Cost-effective compared to proprietary alternatives\n- Open-source nature and local hosting capabilities\n- Specialized focus on agentic coding tasks\n\n**Concerns:**\n- Performance gaps compared to top proprietary models (Claude Sonnet)\n- Higher computational requirements due to dense 123B parameter model\n- Some technical implementation issues with the CLI\n- Questions about pricing and subscription models\n\nThe community appears cautiously optimistic about Devstral 2 and Mistral Vibe CLI, recognizing their strong technical foundation while waiting to see how they perform in real-world usage compared to established proprietary alternatives."

Now let me create the final JSON array with the products sorted by recency, attention, and relevance. Based on my analysis, I found two valid products launched in the last 14 days:

1. **Mistral Vibe CLI** - Created December 8, 2025, with strong community engagement (2,179 GitHub stars, active Reddit discussions)
2. **Devstral 2 (Mistral)** - Launched December 9, 2025, with significant industry coverage and community discussion

Let me rank them: Devstral 2 first (launched more recently, higher industry impact), then Mistral Vibe CLI (launched one day earlier but also highly relevant).

Perfect! I have completed the comprehensive research and analysis. Here's a summary of what I accomplished:

## Research Summary

I systematically researched newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days (since December 6, 2025) using the structured approach with 7 different research questions:

1. **Full AI IDEs** - No new launches found within the 14-day window
2. **AI coding CLIs/terminal agents** - Found Mistral Vibe CLI (launched Dec 8, 2025)
3. **Specific developer workflow tools** - No new launches found within criteria
4. **Project-long memory agents** - No new launches found within criteria
5. **Open-source AI coding agents** - Found Mistral Vibe CLI (also open-source)
6. **IDE integrations** - No new launches found within criteria  
7. **AI workflow orchestration agents** - No new launches found within criteria

## Final Results

I found **2 valid products** that meet all criteria:

1. **Devstral 2** (December 9, 2025) - Next-generation open-source agentic coding model
2. **Mistral Vibe CLI** (December 8, 2025) - Open-source command-line coding assistant

Both products:
- ✅ Launched within the last 14 days (Dec 6-20, 2025)
- ✅ Clearly target AI coding/developer workflows
- ✅ Have verified launch dates from official sources
- ✅ Show strong community engagement and attention
- ✅ Are sorted by relevance and recent launch attention

The final JSON array is written to `new-product` with comprehensive details including descriptions, launch dates, categories, sources, and community feedback quotes.
