[system]
You are an AI research analyst specialized in AI developer tools:
code agents, AI IDEs, AI coding CLIs, and related devtools.

Your **global goal**:
- Find genuinely new products that have been publicly launched in the **last 14 days**
- AND that clearly target **programming / code / AI dev workflows**
- THEN summarize only the valid ones in a **clean YAML list**.

You MUST treat the questions in the `user:` section as your **research QUESTION list**.
Each QUESTION is a different “angle” on the same market (e.g., full AI IDE, CLI, workflow-focused, etc.).

To organize your reasoning, use this formula:

> Answer = Sort( Filter( Union(Sources) ) )

You must conceptually follow these four stages:

1. **Sources → candidate list (per QUESTION)**
   - For each QUESTION from the `user:` section:
     - Search the web and relevant directories / launch pages.
     - Collect as many **candidate products** as are reasonably relevant.
   - For each candidate, internally track at least:
     - `name` (product name)
     - `url` (official homepage or primary landing page)
     - `description` (1–3 sentences in English summarizing what it does)
     - `sources` (which QUESTION(s) and which site(s) you saw it on)
   - At this stage you are allowed to over-collect; do **not** filter by date yet unless it is trivial.

2. **Union(candidates) → unified candidate set**
   - Merge candidates across all QUESTIONS into a single conceptual set:
     - Deduplicate products that clearly refer to the same thing
       (same URL, or obviously the same product name + branding).
   - After this step you have a unified **candidate pool**:
     - It may still contain old products, or products outside our domain.

3. **Filter(Union) → filtered candidate list**
   - For each product in the unified pool:
     - Investigate its **launch / first public release date** from credible public info
       (official site, launch post, Product Hunt / HN launch, blog, press, etc.).
     - Decide if it satisfies **both**:
       1) Launch date is within the last **14 days** (relative to “today”).
       2) Product is clearly related to **AI coding / code agents / IDE / dev workflows**.
   - If you cannot reasonably verify that the launch is within 14 days,
     **treat it as NOT valid** and exclude it.
   - Internally keep, for each surviving product:
     - `release_date` in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (best reasonable guess)
     - short one-line justification (do not put the justification in final YAML).

4. **Sort(filtered candidates) → final ordered list**
   - Only work with products that passed the filter.
   - Rank them by a simple mental score combining:
     - **recency** (more recent launch date is better),
     - **attention** (strong launch signal: PH upvotes, HN discussion, X/Reddit buzz),
     - **relevance** (how closely it fits “AI coding agent / IDE / devtool”).
   - You do not need to show the numeric score, just use it to order the list.


### Claude Code / todo-style planning requirements

When running inside Claude Code with access to a `todowrite` (or similar TODO-list) tool,
you MUST first externalize this plan as an explicit TODO list **before** doing any research.

Follow these rules:

0. Start with a planning item: add `Consider how to update todos based on products` as the very first TODO.

1. Based on the QUESTION list in the `user:` section, use the `todowrite` tool to create **one TODO item per QUESTION**.  
   - Each item should correspond to “Sources(QUESTION_i)” — i.e., collecting candidates for that QUESTION.

2. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Union** stage:  
   - e.g. “Union(all source results)” to merge candidates from all QUESTION-based source tasks.

3. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Filter** stage:  
   - e.g. “Filter(union) by launch date ≤ 14 days and AI coding relevance”.

4. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Sort** stage and final write-out:  
   - e.g. “Sort(filtered) and write result to result.yaml (or final-products.yaml)”.

A minimal example of the TODO list structure you are expected to build is (showing the alternating “record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” steps):

TODO List
- [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
...
- [ ] Union(sources from 1 to 3)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Write result to new-product.json
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

You may have more than 3 QUESTION-based source items (e.g. 7), but the pattern MUST be the same:
first all `Sources(QUESTION i)` items, then one `Union(...)`, one or more `Filter(...)` based on the number of unique products, one `Sort(...)`,
and finally one “write result” item.

You should use this TODO list as the execution plan and mark items as completed as you progress.

After all `Sources(QUESTION i)` tasks are done, you MUST rewrite the TODO list:
- Replace the generic filter items with one `Filter(<product name>)` per discovered product (the count of Filter items must equal the number of products).
- Keep `Sort(filtered)` and the final write step after those filter items.

Example refreshed TODO after finding 3 products:
TODO List
- [ ] Filter(Product Alpha)
- [ ] Filter(Product Beta)
- [ ] Filter(Product Gamma)
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Write result to result.yaml

**Progress logging pattern (few-shot)**
- After EVERY action item, add an explicit “Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” item (and mark it done once you rewrite and overwrite the file).
- This enforces a rhythm of: do a step → record progress → rewrite TODO → update `new-product.json` → next step.
- Sample pattern the model should mirror:
  - [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Union(all source results)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sort(filtered)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Write result to new-product.json
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

**Final output format (what you actually return):**

- Return a **JSON array** of products, sorted from most to least interesting.
- Each entry MUST have the following fields:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "name": "<product name>",
      "url": "<official homepage>",
      "description": "1–3 sentence summary of what this product does, focused on the developer / AI-coding use case.",
      "release_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "category": "<short label, e.g. \"AI IDE\", \"AI coding CLI\", \"code agent\", \"workflow agent\">",
      "sources": ["Product Hunt", "Show HN", "Reddit", "X"],
      "community_quotes": [
        "<short quote from community describing what people like or notice>",
        "<up to 5 quotes total, can be paraphrased but must reflect real feedback>"
      ]
    }
  ]
```

* Only include products that:

  * You have **good evidence** were launched in the last 14 days, and
  * Clearly belong to the **AI coding / developer tools** space.

* If you cannot find any products that satisfy the 14-day constraint,
  return an empty JSON array: `[]`.

Be concise, factual, and avoid marketing fluff. Do **not** include your reasoning text
in the final answer—only the JSON.

**File output + incremental updates requirement**
- Maintain a file named `new-product` in the current working directory.
- After every step (including each “Record progress, rewrite todo”), write the current JSON array to `new-product` (overwrite). Early steps may be partial/rough; later steps should be refined.
- The JSON must always be valid and reflect the best current view (start with `[]` if nothing yet).
- After the final step, ensure `new-product` holds the final sorted array.

## Working Directory Context

Your current working directory is: `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2026-01-21`

All file operations should be relative to this directory.

Below is your QUESTION list. For each QUESTION, treat it as a separate “research lens”
to discover newly launched AI coding products (global constraint: last 14 days).

1. QUESTION 1
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that position themselves as a “full AI IDE” (similar to Windsurf or Cursor), not just a small autocomplete plugin.

2. QUESTION 2
   List newly launched AI coding CLIs or terminal-based agents from the last 14 days that behave like Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, or Claude Code CLI (repo-aware, can run commands, can manage tasks).

3. QUESTION 5
   List newly launched AI tools from the last 14 days that focus on one specific developer workflow (for example debugging, refactoring, test generation, or migration) instead of being a general-purpose coding assistant.

4. QUESTION 7
   List newly launched AI code agents from the last 14 days that advertise “project-long memory” or “workspace memory” across multiple sessions (not just single-chat context).

5. QUESTION 11
   List newly launched open-source AI coding agents from the last 14 days that can be self-hosted or run locally by developers.

6. QUESTION 14
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that integrate directly into existing IDEs (such as VS Code, JetBrains, or Neovim) rather than being a standalone IDE.

7. QUESTION 16
   List newly launched AI agents from the last 14 days that help developers run or orchestrate complex workflows across tools (for example CI/CD, deployment, observability, or incident response), rather than only editing code.

[assistant message #2]
I'll help you discover newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days. Let me start by creating a structured TODO list to organize this research.

However, **Orchids** appears to be a notable AI IDE mentioned, described as \"the AI-powered IDE for building full-stack apps\" with features including:\n- Chat-to-build functionality\n- Voice interaction capabilities\n- Multi-platform support (Mac, Windows, Linux)\n\n**Important Note**: Since the current date is 2025, results for \"2026\" are likely showing future-dated or upcoming category pages, or there may be some confusion in the search results. You may want to verify if you're looking for products launched in 2025 or if you're searching for upcoming/anticipated AI IDE launches.\n\nWould you like me to search with more specific criteria, such as a particular AI IDE name or a different timeframe?\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

      "Based on my web search for \"AI IDE launched 2026 Product Hunt,\" here are the key findings:\n\n## Search Results Summary\n\nThe search returned several relevant Product Hunt category pages and resources for 2026:\n\n1. **AI Coding Agents (2026)** - Category page featuring AI coding agents that automate programming help, suggest code, refactor, debug, and integrate with editors\n\n2. **Vibe Coding Tools (2026)** - A category covering AI-first editors, app builders, and development tools that accelerate building, scraping, and deploying applications\n\n3. **AI Code Editors (2026)** - Listed among the Best of 2026 products\n\n4. **Orchids** - An AI-powered IDE for building full-stack apps with voice and chat interface capabilities\n\n5. **Best of 2026 Leaderboard** - Product Hunt's yearly ranking including AI Coding Agents and AI Code Editors categories\n\n## Notable Observation\n\nThe search results show category pages and collections rather than specific product launch announcements. However, **Orchids** appears to be a notable AI IDE mentioned, described as \"the AI-powered IDE for building full-stack apps\" with features including:\n- Chat-to-build functionality\n- Voice interaction capabilities\n- Multi-platform support (Mac, Windows, Linux)\n\n**Important Note**: Since the current date is 2025, results for \"2026\" are likely showing future-dated or upcoming category pages, or there may be some confusion in the search results. You may want to verify if you're looking for products launched in 2025 or if you're searching for upcoming/anticipated AI IDE launches.\n\nWould you like me to search with more specific criteria, such as a particular AI IDE name or a different timeframe?"

Windsurf & Cursor Alternatives\n\nBased on my search, here's what I found about AI IDE launches and alternatives to Cursor and Windsurf around January 2026:\n\n### **Major AI IDE Launch: Google Antigravity**\n\nThe most significant AI IDE development is **Google Antigravity**, which was announced on November 18, 2025, alongside Gemini 3, and has been gaining attention in January 2026:\n\n- **What it is**: A complete agentic AI development platform (not just an extension/plugin) built on a fork of Visual Studio Code\n- **Key Feature**: Enables developers to delegate complex coding tasks to autonomous AI agents\n- **Pricing**: Free for Gemini 3 users\n- **Release**: Released in late 2025, with continued rollout and features extending into January 2026\n\n**Sources**: \n- [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Antigravity)\n- [Google Developers Blog](https://developers.googleblog.com/build-with-google-antigravity-our-new-agentic-development-platform)\n- [Industry analysis](https://www.digitalapplied.com/blog/cursor-vs-windsurf-vs-google-antigravity-ai-ide-comparison-2026)\n\n---\n\n### **Cursor & Windsurf Alternatives in 2026**\n\nFrom the search results, the main alternatives being discussed include:\n\n1. **Google Antigravity** - Agent-first IDE, positioned as a competitor to both Cursor and Windsurf\n2. **GitHub Copilot** - Ecosystem leader, works within existing IDEs\n3. **JetBrains AI** - Integrated AI coding assistance\n4. **Replit Agent 3** - Full-stack cloud platform\n5. **Zed + AI** - Lightweight, fast editor\n6. **Cline** - Standalone AI coding assistant\n7. **Nxcode** - AI code editor\n\n---\n\n### **Key Comparison Articles**\n- [Cursor vs Windsurf vs Antigravity comparison (Jan 2026)](https://www.digitalapplied.com/blog/cursor-vs-windsurf-vs-google-antigravity-ai-ide-comparison-2026)\n- [Best Cursor Alternatives in 2026](https://www.builder.io/blog/cursor-alternatives-2026)\n- [Windsurf Alternatives Guide](https://www.nocode.mba/articles/windsurf-alternatives)\n\n---\n\n**Note**: I didn't find any specific announcements of brand-new AI IDEs launching specifically in January 2026 beyond Google Antigravity (which launched in late 2025). The main activity has been Antigravity's continued rollout and feature expansions throughout January 2026.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

      "## Search Results: AI IDE Launch January 2026 - Windsurf & Cursor Alternatives\n\nBased on my search, here's what I found about AI IDE launches and alternatives to Cursor and Windsurf around January 2026:\n\n### **Major AI IDE Launch: Google Antigravity**\n\nThe most significant AI IDE development is **Google Antigravity**, which was announced on November 18, 2025, alongside Gemini 3, and has been gaining attention in January 2026:\n\n- **What it is**: A complete agentic AI development platform (not just an extension/plugin) built on a fork of Visual Studio Code\n- **Key Feature**: Enables developers to delegate complex coding tasks to autonomous AI agents\n- **Pricing**: Free for Gemini 3 users\n- **Release**: Released in late 2025, with continued rollout and features extending into January 2026\n\n**Sources**: \n- [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Antigravity)\n- [Google Developers Blog](https://developers.googleblog.com/build-with-google-antigravity-our-new-agentic-development-platform)\n- [Industry analysis](https://www.digitalapplied.com/blog/cursor-vs-windsurf-vs-google-antigravity-ai-ide-comparison-2026)\n\n---\n\n### **Cursor & Windsurf Alternatives in 2026**\n\nFrom the search results, the main alternatives being discussed include:\n\n1. **Google Antigravity** - Agent-first IDE, positioned as a competitor to both Cursor and Windsurf\n2. **GitHub Copilot** - Ecosystem leader, works within existing IDEs\n3. **JetBrains AI** - Integrated AI coding assistance\n4. **Replit Agent 3** - Full-stack cloud platform\n5. **Zed + AI** - Lightweight, fast editor\n6. **Cline** - Standalone AI coding assistant\n7. **Nxcode** - AI code editor\n\n---\n\n### **Key Comparison Articles**\n- [Cursor vs Windsurf vs Antigravity comparison (Jan 2026)](https://www.digitalapplied.com/blog/cursor-vs-windsurf-vs-google-antigravity-ai-ide-comparison-2026)\n- [Best Cursor Alternatives in 2026](https://www.builder.io/blog/cursor-alternatives-2026)\n- [Windsurf Alternatives Guide](https://www.nocode.mba/articles/windsurf-alternatives)\n\n---\n\n**Note**: I didn't find any specific announcements of brand-new AI IDEs launching specifically in January 2026 beyond Google Antigravity (which launched in late 2025). The main activity has been Antigravity's continued rollout and feature expansions throughout January 2026."

        "text": "This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:\nAnalysis:\nLet me chronologically analyze this conversation:\n\n1. **Initial Request**: The user provided a working directory context and a QUESTION list with 7 specific questions about newly launched AI coding products from the last 14 days (Jan 7-21, 2026). The user wants me to discover AI coding tools matching specific criteria.\n\n2. **My Initial Approach**: \n   - Created a TODO list to track progress across all 7 questions\n   - Started researching QUESTION 1 (Full AI IDEs)\n   - Conducted multiple web searches for AI IDE launches in January 2026\n   - Found results like Google Antigravity, Visual Studio 2026, and various comparison articles\n\n3. **Key Findings from Searches**:\n   - Google Antigravity: A complete agentic AI development platform (launched late 2025, rolling out through January 2026)\n   - Visual Studio 2026: Marketed as \"first AI-native IDE\"\n   - Various comparison articles about Cursor, Windsurf, and alternatives\n\n4. **File Operations**:\n   - Attempted to write to new-product.json but got an error (file must be read first)\n   - Successfully read the existing new-product.json file which already contained 8 products from previous research:\n     - Eigent (multi-agent desktop app, 2026-01-21)\n     - AionUi (universal interface for AI coding tools, 2026-01-19)\n     - Yolobox (sandboxed environment, 2026-01-20)\n     - Gambit (agent harness framework, 2026-01-20)\n     - create-vibe-app (scaffolding tool, 2026-01-20)\n     - Hover (browser extension, 2026-01-18)\n     - Phoenix CLI (observability CLI, 2026-01-17)\n     - AudioNoise (Linus Torvalds' project, 2026-01-17)\n\n5. **Continued Research**:\n   - Searched for CLI/terminal agents (QUESTION 2)\n   - Found comparison articles about Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex, OpenCode\n   - Searched for \"Show HN\" posts and found two critical new products from TODAY (2026-01-21):\n     - **Architect**: A terminal grid for running multiple AI coding agents in parallel (https://github.com/forketyfork/architect)\n     - **yolo-cage**: AI coding agents that can't exfiltrate secrets (https://github.com/borenstein/yolo-cage)\n\n6. **Technical Details of New Findings**:\n   - Architect: Built in Zig, uses ghostty-vt terminal emulation, provides visual feedback when agents need attention\n   - yolo-cage: Uses Vagrant VM + MicroK8s, provides sandboxed environment with egress proxy and git/gh dispatcher\n\n7. **TODO List Updates**: Updated the TODO list to mark completed tasks and set the union/merge task as \"in_progress\"\n\n8. **Current State**: The conversation ends with me having found two new products from today's Show HN and being in the process of merging all findings into the new-product.json file. I need to add Architect and yolo-cage to the existing 8 products.\n\n**Important Notes**:\n- The working directory is `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2026-01-21`\n- The date context suggests we're working on January 21, 2026\n- All questions require products from \"last 14 days\" (Jan 7-21, 2026)\n- I found 2 new products from today (Jan 21) that need to be added to the file\n\nSummary:\n1. **Primary Request and Intent**:\n   The user requested discovery of newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days (January 7-21, 2026) across 7 specific categories:\n   - QUESTION 1: Full AI IDEs (similar to Windsurf/Cursor)\n   - QUESTION 2: AI coding CLIs or terminal-based agents (repo-aware, command-running)\n   - QUESTION 5: Workflow-specific AI tools (debugging, refactoring, test generation, migration)\n   - QUESTION 7: AI code agents with project/workspace memory across sessions\n   - QUESTION 11: Open-source AI coding agents (self-hosted/local)\n   - QUESTION 14: AI tools integrating into existing IDEs (VS Code, JetBrains, Neovim)\n   - QUESTION 16: AI agents for orchestration/workflows (CI/CD, deployment, observability)\n\n   The user wants me to research each category, filter results by launch date and relevance, and compile findings into `new-product.json`.\n\n2. **Key Technical Concepts**:\n   - Multi-agent AI coding workflows (running Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI in parallel)\n   - Terminal-based AI coding agents\n   - Sandbox isolation for AI agents (VMs, containers, microK8s)\n   - Secret exfiltration prevention in AI coding workflows\n   - AI-native IDEs vs. traditional IDEs with AI plugins\n   - \"Vibe coding\" methodology\n   - Agent orchestration and harness frameworks\n   - Egress proxy filtering for AI agents\n   - Git/GitHub operation dispatching and branch isolation\n\n3. **Files and Code Sections**:\n   \n   - **`/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2026-01-21/new-product.json`**\n     - **Why important**: Main output file containing discovered AI coding products\n     - **Current state**: Contains 8 products from previous research\n     - **Full current content**:\n     ```json\n     [\n       {\n         \"name\": \"Eigent\",\n         \"url\": \"https://github.com/eigent-ai/eigent\",\n         \"description\": \"The world's first open-source multi-agent workforce desktop application.

Read it first before writing to it.\"\n     - **Fix**: Used `Read` tool to read the file before attempting modifications\n     - **No user feedback**: This was a system constraint that I resolved independently\n\n5. **Problem Solving**:\n   - Successfully identified 8 existing products in the database from previous research\n   - Discovered 2 new products from today's Show HN (January 21, 2026):\n     - **Architect**: Addresses the problem of managing multiple AI coding agents simultaneously by providing a visual grid interface with status highlighting\n     - **yolo-cage**: Solves the security problem of AI agents potentially exfiltrating secrets or making unauthorized git operations by sandboxing them in a VM with egress filtering\n   - Both new products align with multiple questions from the user's list (QUESTION 2: CLI/terminal agents, QUESTION 11: open-source, QUESTION 16: orchestration tools)\n\n6. **All User Messages**:\n   - Initial message providing working directory context and 7 specific questions about newly launched AI coding products from the last 14 days (Jan 7-21, 2026), with instructions to treat each question as a separate \"research lens\"\n   - Request for detailed conversation summary\n\n7. **Pending Tasks**:\n   - Filter and validate Architect by launch date and AI coding relevance\n   - Filter and validate yolo-cage by launch date and AI coding relevance\n   - Add Architect and yolo-cage to new-product.json\n   - Complete filtering of existing products (Eigent, AionUi, Yolobox, Gambit, create-vibe-app, Hover, Phoenix CLI, AudioNoise)\n   - Sort all products and write final result to new-product.json\n   - Perform final output formatting and verification\n\n8. **Current Work**:\n   I was in the process of researching AI coding tools across all 7 question categories. Most recently, I had:\n   - Completed web searches across all question areas\n   - Successfully discovered two significant new products from today's Show HN (January 21, 2026):\n     - **Architect**: A terminal grid for running multiple AI coding agents in parallel (https://github.com/forketyfork/architect)\n     - **yolo-cage**: A sandboxing system for AI coding agents (https://github.com/borenstein/yolo-cage)\n   - Retrieved detailed information from both GitHub repositories\n   - Updated the TODO list to mark research phases as completed\n   - Set the \"Union(all source results) - deduplicate and merge candidates\" task to \"in_progress\"\n   \n   The immediate next step is to add these two new products to the new-product.json file and continue with the filtering and validation process.\n\n9. **Optional Next Step**:\n   Add the two newly discovered products (Architect and yolo-cage) to the new-product.json file. These are both from today (January 21, 2026), which is within the 14-day window (Jan 7-21, 2026), and they directly address multiple questions from the user's list.\n   \n   From the conversation: \"I was in the process of researching AI coding tools across all 7 question areas\" and had \"successfully discovered two significant new products from today's Show HN (January 21, 2026): Architect and yolo-cage.\" The TODO list shows I should now proceed with \"Filter(Architect)\" and \"Filter(yolo-cage)\" followed by \"Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json.\".\nPlease continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on."

Good! I found that:
- **Architect**: Created 2025-11-07 (too old - outside the 14-day window of Jan 7-21, 2026)
- **yolo-cage**: Created 2026-01-11 (within the 14-day window!)

However, I need to verify when Architect was actually **launched/publicly announced** (the Show HN post), not just when the repo was created. Let me check the Show HN post date:

Perfect! Now I have confirmed both products. Let me check the actual dates more carefully:

- **Architect**: The HN post link confirms it was posted on **2026-01-21** (based on the blog post link in the content: `forketyfork.github.io/blog/2026/01/21/...`)
- **yolo-cage**: Posted **7 hours ago** on HN (in 2026-01-21), repo created **2026-01-11**

Now let me update the new-product.json file with both new products and then proceed with filtering:
