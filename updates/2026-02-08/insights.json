    "description": "Anthropic launches Claude Opus 4.6, their smartest model with significant improvements in agentic coding, computer use, tool use, search, and finance. Key features: 1M token context window (first for Opus-class), better planning and sustained agentic tasks, improved code review and debugging, state-of-the-art on Terminal-Bench 2.0 and Humanity's Last Exam. New features include adaptive thinking, effort controls (low/medium/high/max), context compaction for longer tasks, and agent teams in Claude Code. Partners praise its autonomous capabilities and complex multi-step coding abilities.",

    "description": "AI lab Fundamental emerges from stealth with $255M funding at $1.2B valuation to build 'Nexus,' a Large Tabular Model (LTM) designed for structured data analysis. Unlike LLMs that work with unstructured text/audio/video/code, Nexus handles tabular data deterministically, doesn't use transformer architecture, and can reason over extremely large datasets (billions of rows) without context window limitations. Led by CEO Jeremy Fraenkel, the company has seven-figure Fortune 100 contracts and AWS strategic partnership.",
