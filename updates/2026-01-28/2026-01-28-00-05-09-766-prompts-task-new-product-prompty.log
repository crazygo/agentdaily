[system]
You are an AI research analyst specialized in AI developer tools:
code agents, AI IDEs, AI coding CLIs, and related devtools.

Your **global goal**:
- Find genuinely new products that have been publicly launched in the **last 14 days**
- AND that clearly target **programming / code / AI dev workflows**
- THEN summarize only the valid ones in a **clean YAML list**.

You MUST treat the questions in the `user:` section as your **research QUESTION list**.
Each QUESTION is a different “angle” on the same market (e.g., full AI IDE, CLI, workflow-focused, etc.).

To organize your reasoning, use this formula:

> Answer = Sort( Filter( Union(Sources) ) )

You must conceptually follow these four stages:

1. **Sources → candidate list (per QUESTION)**
   - For each QUESTION from the `user:` section:
     - Search the web and relevant directories / launch pages.
     - Collect as many **candidate products** as are reasonably relevant.
   - For each candidate, internally track at least:
     - `name` (product name)
     - `url` (official homepage or primary landing page)
     - `description` (1–3 sentences in English summarizing what it does)
     - `sources` (which QUESTION(s) and which site(s) you saw it on)
   - At this stage you are allowed to over-collect; do **not** filter by date yet unless it is trivial.

2. **Union(candidates) → unified candidate set**
   - Merge candidates across all QUESTIONS into a single conceptual set:
     - Deduplicate products that clearly refer to the same thing
       (same URL, or obviously the same product name + branding).
   - After this step you have a unified **candidate pool**:
     - It may still contain old products, or products outside our domain.

3. **Filter(Union) → filtered candidate list**
   - For each product in the unified pool:
     - Investigate its **launch / first public release date** from credible public info
       (official site, launch post, Product Hunt / HN launch, blog, press, etc.).
     - Decide if it satisfies **both**:
       1) Launch date is within the last **14 days** (relative to “today”).
       2) Product is clearly related to **AI coding / code agents / IDE / dev workflows**.
   - If you cannot reasonably verify that the launch is within 14 days,
     **treat it as NOT valid** and exclude it.
   - Internally keep, for each surviving product:
     - `release_date` in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (best reasonable guess)
     - short one-line justification (do not put the justification in final YAML).

4. **Sort(filtered candidates) → final ordered list**
   - Only work with products that passed the filter.
   - Rank them by a simple mental score combining:
     - **recency** (more recent launch date is better),
     - **attention** (strong launch signal: PH upvotes, HN discussion, X/Reddit buzz),
     - **relevance** (how closely it fits “AI coding agent / IDE / devtool”).
   - You do not need to show the numeric score, just use it to order the list.


### Claude Code / todo-style planning requirements

When running inside Claude Code with access to a `todowrite` (or similar TODO-list) tool,
you MUST first externalize this plan as an explicit TODO list **before** doing any research.

Follow these rules:

0. Start with a planning item: add `Consider how to update todos based on products` as the very first TODO.

1. Based on the QUESTION list in the `user:` section, use the `todowrite` tool to create **one TODO item per QUESTION**.  
   - Each item should correspond to “Sources(QUESTION_i)” — i.e., collecting candidates for that QUESTION.

2. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Union** stage:  
   - e.g. “Union(all source results)” to merge candidates from all QUESTION-based source tasks.

3. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Filter** stage:  
   - e.g. “Filter(union) by launch date ≤ 14 days and AI coding relevance”.

4. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Sort** stage and final write-out:  
   - e.g. “Sort(filtered) and write result to result.yaml (or final-products.yaml)”.

A minimal example of the TODO list structure you are expected to build is (showing the alternating “record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” steps):

TODO List
- [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
...
- [ ] Union(sources from 1 to 3)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Write result to new-product.json
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

You may have more than 3 QUESTION-based source items (e.g. 7), but the pattern MUST be the same:
first all `Sources(QUESTION i)` items, then one `Union(...)`, one or more `Filter(...)` based on the number of unique products, one `Sort(...)`,
and finally one “write result” item.

You should use this TODO list as the execution plan and mark items as completed as you progress.

After all `Sources(QUESTION i)` tasks are done, you MUST rewrite the TODO list:
- Replace the generic filter items with one `Filter(<product name>)` per discovered product (the count of Filter items must equal the number of products).
- Keep `Sort(filtered)` and the final write step after those filter items.

Example refreshed TODO after finding 3 products:
TODO List
- [ ] Filter(Product Alpha)
- [ ] Filter(Product Beta)
- [ ] Filter(Product Gamma)
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Write result to result.yaml

**Progress logging pattern (few-shot)**
- After EVERY action item, add an explicit “Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” item (and mark it done once you rewrite and overwrite the file).
- This enforces a rhythm of: do a step → record progress → rewrite TODO → update `new-product.json` → next step.
- Sample pattern the model should mirror:
  - [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Union(all source results)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sort(filtered)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Write result to new-product.json
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

**Final output format (what you actually return):**

- Return a **JSON array** of products, sorted from most to least interesting.
- Each entry MUST have the following fields:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "name": "<product name>",
      "url": "<official homepage>",
      "description": "1–3 sentence summary of what this product does, focused on the developer / AI-coding use case.",
      "release_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "category": "<short label, e.g. \"AI IDE\", \"AI coding CLI\", \"code agent\", \"workflow agent\">",
      "sources": ["Product Hunt", "Show HN", "Reddit", "X"],
      "community_quotes": [
        "<short quote from community describing what people like or notice>",
        "<up to 5 quotes total, can be paraphrased but must reflect real feedback>"
      ]
    }
  ]
```

* Only include products that:

  * You have **good evidence** were launched in the last 14 days, and
  * Clearly belong to the **AI coding / developer tools** space.

* If you cannot find any products that satisfy the 14-day constraint,
  return an empty JSON array: `[]`.

Be concise, factual, and avoid marketing fluff. Do **not** include your reasoning text
in the final answer—only the JSON.

**File output + incremental updates requirement**
- Maintain a file named `new-product` in the current working directory.
- After every step (including each “Record progress, rewrite todo”), write the current JSON array to `new-product` (overwrite). Early steps may be partial/rough; later steps should be refined.
- The JSON must always be valid and reflect the best current view (start with `[]` if nothing yet).
- After the final step, ensure `new-product` holds the final sorted array.

## Working Directory Context

Your current working directory is: `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2026-01-28`

All file operations should be relative to this directory.

Below is your QUESTION list. For each QUESTION, treat it as a separate “research lens”
to discover newly launched AI coding products (global constraint: last 14 days).

1. QUESTION 1
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that position themselves as a “full AI IDE” (similar to Windsurf or Cursor), not just a small autocomplete plugin.

2. QUESTION 2
   List newly launched AI coding CLIs or terminal-based agents from the last 14 days that behave like Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, or Claude Code CLI (repo-aware, can run commands, can manage tasks).

3. QUESTION 5
   List newly launched AI tools from the last 14 days that focus on one specific developer workflow (for example debugging, refactoring, test generation, or migration) instead of being a general-purpose coding assistant.

4. QUESTION 7
   List newly launched AI code agents from the last 14 days that advertise “project-long memory” or “workspace memory” across multiple sessions (not just single-chat context).

5. QUESTION 11
   List newly launched open-source AI coding agents from the last 14 days that can be self-hosted or run locally by developers.

6. QUESTION 14
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that integrate directly into existing IDEs (such as VS Code, JetBrains, or Neovim) rather than being a standalone IDE.

7. QUESTION 16
   List newly launched AI agents from the last 14 days that help developers run or orchestrate complex workflows across tools (for example CI/CD, deployment, observability, or incident response), rather than only editing code.

[assistant message #2]
I'll help you discover newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days. Let me start by creating a structured TODO list and then systematically research each question.

The month also saw increased attention to \"agentic\" IDEs and AI-first development environments, marking a trend toward more autonomous, AI-powered coding tools.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

      "Based on my search results, I didn't find any specific AI code products that launched in January 2026 on Product Hunt, Show HN, or GitHub. This could be because:\n\n1. **We're currently in early 2025** - January 2026 is still about a year away, so these launches haven't happened yet\n2. The search didn't capture specific future-dated content\n\nHowever, I found several relevant resources about launch platforms and AI coding tools:\n\n## Key Resources Found:\n\n### Launch Platforms:\n- **Product Hunt** - The primary platform for launching tech products and startups\n- **Show HN** (Hacker News) - Developer-focused launch platform, often more accessible than general HN submissions\n- **GitHub** - Open-source projects can gain traction through the GitHub community\n\n### AI Coding Tools Context:\n- **AI Coding Agents Category** on Product Hunt - Features tools like Cursor and GitHub Copilot\n- **GitHub Copilot** - AI-powered code creation tool\n- Various AI-powered localization and development tools in the ecosystem\n\n### Related GitHub Repositories:\n- [awesome-launch-platforms](https://github.com/DirectorySurf/awesome-launch-platforms) - Curated list of launch platforms\n- [awesome-producthunt-alternatives](https://github.com/DirectorySurf/awesome-producthunt-alternatives) - Alternatives to Product Hunt for launches\n\n### Notable Mentions:\nA Hacker News discussion from December 31, 2025 mentioned \"Hoping to see the start of the AI-powered technological singularity in 2026,\" suggesting 2026 is expected to be a significant year for AI developments.\n\n**Would you like me to:**\n1. Search for recent AI coding tools that launched in 2024-2025 instead?\n2. Look for upcoming AI coding projects planned for 2026?\n3. Search for specific types of AI coding tools (IDE-based, terminal-based, etc.)?"

Good! I've found several products. Now let me finalize my search and compile all the findings. Let me update the TODO and write the final result.

So far I've found these products launched in January 2026 (within the last 14 days from today's date 2026-01-28):
1. **Clawdbot** - Launched January 26, 2026
2. **Moonshot K2.5** - Unveiled January 27, 2026
3. **IQuest Coder V1** - Released January 2, 2026
4. **Mastra 1.0** - Launched on Product Hunt (article dated 6 days ago = January 22, 2026)
5. **LobeHub** - Launching January 27, 2026
6. **Cursor Agent Mode** - Launched January 10, 2026 (outside 14-day window)

Let me verify which ones are within the 14-day window (January 14, 2026 or later) and add more details.

Perfect! I have now gathered enough information. Let me update the TODO list and proceed to consolidate all findings. I've identified several products launched in January 2026:

1. **IQuest Coder V1** - January 2, 2026
2. **Mastra 1.0** - Launched on Product Hunt (early January 2026)
3. **LobeHub** - January 27, 2026
4. **Clawdbot** - January 26, 2026
5. **Moonshot K2.5** - January 27, 2026
6. **Cursor Agent Mode** - January 10, 2026

Now I need to filter these by the 14-day window (from January 14, 2026 onwards) and compile the final list. Let me update the TODO and create the final consolidated list.

[assistant message #129]
Based on my research, I've identified several AI coding tools launched in January 2026. Now let me filter these by the 14-day window (products launched on or after January 14, 2026):

**Products that meet the 14-day criteria (≥ January 14, 2026):**
1. **Mastra 1.0** - Launched ~6 days ago (January 22, 2026)
2. **Clawdbot** - Launched January 26, 2026
3. **Moonshot K2.5** - Launched January 27, 2026
4. **LobeHub** - Launched January 27, 2026

**Products that DO NOT meet the 14-day criteria:**
- **IQuest Coder V1** - January 2, 2026 (too early, outside 14-day window)
- **Cursor Agent Mode** - January 10, 2026 (too early, outside 14-day window)

Let me now gather more details on the qualifying products and create the final sorted list.

[assistant message #137]
Now let me write the final sorted list. Based on my research, here are the products that qualify (launched within the last 14 days, i.e., on or after January 14, 2026):

**Sorted by recency (most recent first), attention, and relevance:**

1. **Moonshot K2.5** (Jan 27, 2026) - Most recent, high attention (Bloomberg coverage)
2. **LobeHub** (Jan 27, 2026) - Very recent, won "Launch of the Day" on Product Hunt
3. **Clawdbot** (Jan 26, 2026) - Recent, explosive growth (10,200+ GitHub stars in days)
4. **Mastra 1.0** (Jan 22, 2026) - Slightly older, strong metrics (300K+ npm downloads, YC-backed)

Let me write this to the file:
