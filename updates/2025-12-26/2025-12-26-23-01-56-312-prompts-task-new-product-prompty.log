[system]
You are an AI research analyst specialized in AI developer tools:
code agents, AI IDEs, AI coding CLIs, and related devtools.

Your **global goal**:
- Find genuinely new products that have been publicly launched in the **last 14 days**
- AND that clearly target **programming / code / AI dev workflows**
- THEN summarize only the valid ones in a **clean YAML list**.

You MUST treat the questions in the `user:` section as your **research QUESTION list**.
Each QUESTION is a different “angle” on the same market (e.g., full AI IDE, CLI, workflow-focused, etc.).

To organize your reasoning, use this formula:

> Answer = Sort( Filter( Union(Sources) ) )

You must conceptually follow these four stages:

1. **Sources → candidate list (per QUESTION)**
   - For each QUESTION from the `user:` section:
     - Search the web and relevant directories / launch pages.
     - Collect as many **candidate products** as are reasonably relevant.
   - For each candidate, internally track at least:
     - `name` (product name)
     - `url` (official homepage or primary landing page)
     - `description` (1–3 sentences in English summarizing what it does)
     - `sources` (which QUESTION(s) and which site(s) you saw it on)
   - At this stage you are allowed to over-collect; do **not** filter by date yet unless it is trivial.

2. **Union(candidates) → unified candidate set**
   - Merge candidates across all QUESTIONS into a single conceptual set:
     - Deduplicate products that clearly refer to the same thing
       (same URL, or obviously the same product name + branding).
   - After this step you have a unified **candidate pool**:
     - It may still contain old products, or products outside our domain.

3. **Filter(Union) → filtered candidate list**
   - For each product in the unified pool:
     - Investigate its **launch / first public release date** from credible public info
       (official site, launch post, Product Hunt / HN launch, blog, press, etc.).
     - Decide if it satisfies **both**:
       1) Launch date is within the last **14 days** (relative to “today”).
       2) Product is clearly related to **AI coding / code agents / IDE / dev workflows**.
   - If you cannot reasonably verify that the launch is within 14 days,
     **treat it as NOT valid** and exclude it.
   - Internally keep, for each surviving product:
     - `release_date` in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (best reasonable guess)
     - short one-line justification (do not put the justification in final YAML).

4. **Sort(filtered candidates) → final ordered list**
   - Only work with products that passed the filter.
   - Rank them by a simple mental score combining:
     - **recency** (more recent launch date is better),
     - **attention** (strong launch signal: PH upvotes, HN discussion, X/Reddit buzz),
     - **relevance** (how closely it fits “AI coding agent / IDE / devtool”).
   - You do not need to show the numeric score, just use it to order the list.


### Claude Code / todo-style planning requirements

When running inside Claude Code with access to a `todowrite` (or similar TODO-list) tool,
you MUST first externalize this plan as an explicit TODO list **before** doing any research.

Follow these rules:

0. Start with a planning item: add `Consider how to update todos based on products` as the very first TODO.

1. Based on the QUESTION list in the `user:` section, use the `todowrite` tool to create **one TODO item per QUESTION**.  
   - Each item should correspond to “Sources(QUESTION_i)” — i.e., collecting candidates for that QUESTION.

2. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Union** stage:  
   - e.g. “Union(all source results)” to merge candidates from all QUESTION-based source tasks.

3. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Filter** stage:  
   - e.g. “Filter(union) by launch date ≤ 14 days and AI coding relevance”.

4. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Sort** stage and final write-out:  
   - e.g. “Sort(filtered) and write result to result.yaml (or final-products.yaml)”.

A minimal example of the TODO list structure you are expected to build is (showing the alternating “record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” steps):

TODO List
- [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
...
- [ ] Union(sources from 1 to 3)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Write result to new-product.json
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

You may have more than 3 QUESTION-based source items (e.g. 7), but the pattern MUST be the same:
first all `Sources(QUESTION i)` items, then one `Union(...)`, one or more `Filter(...)` based on the number of unique products, one `Sort(...)`,
and finally one “write result” item.

You should use this TODO list as the execution plan and mark items as completed as you progress.

After all `Sources(QUESTION i)` tasks are done, you MUST rewrite the TODO list:
- Replace the generic filter items with one `Filter(<product name>)` per discovered product (the count of Filter items must equal the number of products).
- Keep `Sort(filtered)` and the final write step after those filter items.

Example refreshed TODO after finding 3 products:
TODO List
- [ ] Filter(Product Alpha)
- [ ] Filter(Product Beta)
- [ ] Filter(Product Gamma)
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Write result to result.yaml

**Progress logging pattern (few-shot)**
- After EVERY action item, add an explicit “Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” item (and mark it done once you rewrite and overwrite the file).
- This enforces a rhythm of: do a step → record progress → rewrite TODO → update `new-product.json` → next step.
- Sample pattern the model should mirror:
  - [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Union(all source results)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sort(filtered)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Write result to new-product.json
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

**Final output format (what you actually return):**

- Return a **JSON array** of products, sorted from most to least interesting.
- Each entry MUST have the following fields:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "name": "<product name>",
      "url": "<official homepage>",
      "description": "1–3 sentence summary of what this product does, focused on the developer / AI-coding use case.",
      "release_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "category": "<short label, e.g. \"AI IDE\", \"AI coding CLI\", \"code agent\", \"workflow agent\">",
      "sources": ["Product Hunt", "Show HN", "Reddit", "X"],
      "community_quotes": [
        "<short quote from community describing what people like or notice>",
        "<up to 5 quotes total, can be paraphrased but must reflect real feedback>"
      ]
    }
  ]
```

* Only include products that:

  * You have **good evidence** were launched in the last 14 days, and
  * Clearly belong to the **AI coding / developer tools** space.

* If you cannot find any products that satisfy the 14-day constraint,
  return an empty JSON array: `[]`.

Be concise, factual, and avoid marketing fluff. Do **not** include your reasoning text
in the final answer—only the JSON.

**File output + incremental updates requirement**
- Maintain a file named `new-product` in the current working directory.
- After every step (including each “Record progress, rewrite todo”), write the current JSON array to `new-product` (overwrite). Early steps may be partial/rough; later steps should be refined.
- The JSON must always be valid and reflect the best current view (start with `[]` if nothing yet).
- After the final step, ensure `new-product` holds the final sorted array.

## Working Directory Context

Your current working directory is: `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2025-12-26`

All file operations should be relative to this directory.

Below is your QUESTION list. For each QUESTION, treat it as a separate “research lens”
to discover newly launched AI coding products (global constraint: last 14 days).

1. QUESTION 1
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that position themselves as a “full AI IDE” (similar to Windsurf or Cursor), not just a small autocomplete plugin.

2. QUESTION 2
   List newly launched AI coding CLIs or terminal-based agents from the last 14 days that behave like Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, or Claude Code CLI (repo-aware, can run commands, can manage tasks).

3. QUESTION 5
   List newly launched AI tools from the last 14 days that focus on one specific developer workflow (for example debugging, refactoring, test generation, or migration) instead of being a general-purpose coding assistant.

4. QUESTION 7
   List newly launched AI code agents from the last 14 days that advertise “project-long memory” or “workspace memory” across multiple sessions (not just single-chat context).

5. QUESTION 11
   List newly launched open-source AI coding agents from the last 14 days that can be self-hosted or run locally by developers.

6. QUESTION 14
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that integrate directly into existing IDEs (such as VS Code, JetBrains, or Neovim) rather than being a standalone IDE.

7. QUESTION 16
   List newly launched AI agents from the last 14 days that help developers run or orchestrate complex workflows across tools (for example CI/CD, deployment, observability, or incident response), rather than only editing code.

Here are the key findings:\n\n## Search Results\n\nSince December 2025 is still in the future (current date is June 2025), the search results primarily show information about 2024-2025 AI IDE trends and Product Hunt awards. Here's what I found:\n\n### Notable AI IDE Products on Product Hunt:\n\n1. **Cursor** - The AI Code Editor\n   - Won Product Hunt's \"Product of the Year\" for 2024 in the Golden Kitty Awards\n   - Considered the leading AI-powered IDE with real-time collaboration features\n   - Praised for significantly improving developer efficiency\n\n2. **Other Top AI Coding Tools:**\n   - **GitHub Copilot** - IDE-based AI coding assistant\n   - **Claude Code** - AI code editor for multi-file changes and deep context\n   - **Windsurf** - Handles agentic delivery in AI coding\n\n3. **Categories Available:**\n   - Product Hunt has dedicated categories for:\n     - [AI Coding Agents](https://www.producthunt.com/categories/ai-coding-agents)\n     - [AI Code Editors](https://www.producthunt.com/categories/ai-code-editors)\n   - There's also a tag page for **AI IDE** products\n\n### Product Hunt Golden Kitty Awards 2024:\n- Awards covered 16 categories including developer tools, AI models, AI copilot, and more\n- Many AI products were recognized across different categories\n\n### Note:\nSince December 2025 hasn't occurred yet, there are no specific results for AI IDE products launched in that month. You may want to search for more recent AI IDE launches or check Product Hunt's current trending products in the AI development tools category.\n\nWould you like me to search for more specific information about current AI IDE products or recent launches in 2025?"

Here's what I found:\n\n## Key Findings:\n\n### Product Hunt AI Coding Tool Categories:\n1. **[AI Coding Agents Category](https://www.producthunt.com/categories/ai-coding-agents)** - Dedicated section for AI coding agents\n2. **[AI Code Editors Category](https://www.producthunt.com/categories/ai-code-editors)** - Features AI coding tools and agentic IDEs\n\n### Notable AI Coding Tools Found:\n- **Zencoder** - Marketed as \"The first AI software engineer\" with 5.0 rating\n- **OpenCode** - An \"AI pair programmer\" with 4.8 rating (21 reviews)\n- **Kilo Code** - Open source AI coding assistant for planning, building & fixing code\n\n### Related Insights:\n- A developer shared their experience of creating a **#1 Product Hunt tool in hours using AI** in January 2025\n- There's discussion about how Product Hunt has changed, with many noting that AI tools dominate the platform\n- The platform appears to be very active with AI coding tools, with categories dedicated to them\n\n### Limitations:\nThe search didn't return specific results for a major December 2025 AI coding tool launch. This could be because:\n- December 2025 may be too recent or in the future\n- The specific launch may not have received widespread coverage\n- Search results may be more focused on currently trending tools\n\nWould you like me to refine the search with different parameters, or are you looking for information about a specific AI coding tool?"

Based on my research so far, I'm not finding many specific launches from December 12-26, 2025 (the last 14 days). This suggests that either:
1. There genuinely haven't been many major AI coding tool launches in this specific 14-day period
2. Launches are not yet widely indexed or covered

Let me continue searching through the remaining questions and then consolidate findings. Let me now search for the remaining questions more efficiently by using the Task agent to do comprehensive parallel searches:

      "Based on my search results, I was not able to find any specific articles from TechCrunch or VentureBeat about AI coding tools or IDE launches in December 2025. The site filter did not return relevant results from those publications.\n\nHowever, I did find related information about AI coding tools and IDEs from December 2025 from other sources:\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n1. **Google Antigravity Launch (December 9, 2025)**\n   - Google launched an AI-powered coding platform called \"Antigravity\"\n   - Described as an \"agent-first platform powered by Gemini 3\"\n   - Features both an Editor and Manager view for AI-assisted coding\n   - Source: StrategyDriven\n\n2. **General AI Coding Tools Coverage in December 2025**\n   - Multiple publications released \"best of\" lists for AI coding assistants\n   - The market trend highlighted the \"Agentic Era\" - moving beyond simple IDE chatbots to more sophisticated agentic CLI tools\n   - Source: The New Stack (Dec 17, 2025)\n\n3. **Market Statistics**\n   - 84% of developers now use AI coding tools (up from 76% the previous year)\n   - The market continues to see significant growth and new tool launches\n\n**Popular AI Coding Tools/IDEs Mentioned:**\n- Cursor AI\n- Claude Code\n- Windsurf\n- GitHub Copilot\n- Replit (with Ghostwriter)\n- JetBrains AI Assistant\n- Zed\n\nIt appears that while there was activity in the AI coding tools space in December 2025, TechCrunch and VentureBeat may not have covered specific IDE launches during that period, or those articles are not readily accessible through search."

Now let me consolidate the union of all findings and create a comprehensive candidate list. From my research and the Task agent's comprehensive search, I need to verify which products were actually launched in the last 14 days (December 12-26, 2025). Let me verify the specific launch dates for the most promising candidates:

[assistant message #158]
Perfect! Now I have verified several launches within the December 12-26, 2025 window. Let me consolidate and create the final filtered list. Based on my research, the products that were launched in the last 14 days (Dec 12-26, 2025) are:

1. **Toad** - December 18, 2025 - unified terminal UI for AI coding agents
2. **Google Agent Designer (Vertex AI)** - December 18, 2025 - low-code visual designer for AI agents
3. **Agentic AI Foundation** - December 9, 2025 (just outside 14-day window, this is Dec 9 which is 17 days ago)

Wait, let me recalculate. Today is December 26, 2025. The last 14 days would be December 12-26, 2025. So:
- December 9 is outside the window (that's 17 days ago)
- December 11 is outside the window (that's 15 days ago)
- December 18 is within the window (8 days ago)

So from my verified findings:
1. **Toad** - December 18, 2025 ✓
2. **Google Agent Designer (Vertex AI)** - December 18, 2025 ✓

Let me also check the products from the existing database to see if they qualify:

[assistant message #182]
Perfect! The file has been written correctly. Now let me provide the final summary to the user.

## Summary

I completed a comprehensive search for AI coding tools launched in the last 14 days (December 12-26, 2025) across 7 different research questions covering:

1. Full AI IDEs
2. AI coding CLIs/terminal agents
3. Workflow-specific AI tools
4. Project-long memory AI agents
5. Open-source AI coding agents
6. IDE-integrated AI tools
7. Workflow orchestration agents

### Final Results

I found **3 verified products** launched within the December 12-26, 2025 window:

1. **Vibe Pocket** (December 23, 2025) - A mobile/web platform for running CLI AI agents like Claude Code and Codex from any device

2. **Toad** (December 18, 2025) - A unified terminal UI that consolidates 12+ AI coding agent CLIs under a single, refined interface

3. **Google Agent Designer (Vertex AI)** (December 18, 2025) - A low-code visual designer for building and orchestrating AI agents in Google Cloud

### Key Findings

The holiday period (December 23-26) showed minimal new launches, which is typical for the Christmas season. Most activity occurred December 12-19, 2025, with the notable launches being:

- **Terminal/CLI innovation** (Toad)
- **Mobile-first AI coding** (Vibe Pocket)
- **Enterprise low-code agent building** (Google Agent Designer)

The results have been written to `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2025-12-26/new-product.json` in the required JSON format.
