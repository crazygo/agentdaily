    "description": "Anthropic's engineering team demonstrated the power of multi-agent AI workflows by building a Rust-based C compiler from scratch using 16 Claude AI agents working in parallel. The project involved nearly 2,000 Claude Code sessions, cost $20,000 in API costs, and produced a 100,000-line compiler capable of compiling Linux 6.9 on x86, ARM, and RISC architectures. Led by Nicholas Carlini from Anthropic's Safeguards team, the experiment showcases coordinated multi-agent systems but notes that deep human management remains essential despite autonomous agent teams.",
