    "title": "Karpathy's 'Vibe Coding' Paradigm Gains Traction in Developer Community",
    "description": "Andrej Karpathy's concept of 'vibe coding' - where developers fully embrace AI assistance and rely on intuition rather than traditional coding practices - has become a major discussion point. The approach involves coding through natural language conversation with AI models, focusing on problem-solving atmosphere rather than code details. This represents a shift toward what some call 'Software 3.0' where LLMs become programmable through natural language prompts.",
