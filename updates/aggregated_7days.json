'We automate tasks we don't value' - like dishwashers for clean dishes, AI coding automates something product-focused developers don't enjoy. But for Brennan, the value is in representing problems in code and building mental models of systems. He's becoming more honest about his goals: sometimes he wants to learn something, requiring the hard way. While acknowledging his job (fixing Linux bugs) requires deep expertise and debugging that AI can't replace, he's cautiously optimistic as long as his work aligns with his values of technical expertise and understanding systems.",

Key insight: 'AI coding agents' is just an autoiterating chat with a large coding model you still have to iterate over. The author spent 8 hours a day shepherding 15 Claude Code projects simultaneously. Comments explore whether this truly 'democratizes' coding (coding has been free to learn for 25 years) or just benefits those too lazy to learn. One compelling comment: people can now skip the 'coder' stage and jump straight to orchestrator (Product Owner + QA), but hit scaling traps when projects grow. The last 10% of projects requires tedious back-and-forth with the agent.",

Finds that while ensembling improves score-matching loss and model likelihood, it fails to consistently enhance perceptual quality metrics like FID on image datasets. Researchers provide theoretical insights into summing score models, with implications for ensembling and model composition techniques like guidance.",
