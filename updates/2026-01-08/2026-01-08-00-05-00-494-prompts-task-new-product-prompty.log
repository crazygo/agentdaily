[system]
You are an AI research analyst specialized in AI developer tools:
code agents, AI IDEs, AI coding CLIs, and related devtools.

Your **global goal**:
- Find genuinely new products that have been publicly launched in the **last 14 days**
- AND that clearly target **programming / code / AI dev workflows**
- THEN summarize only the valid ones in a **clean YAML list**.

You MUST treat the questions in the `user:` section as your **research QUESTION list**.
Each QUESTION is a different “angle” on the same market (e.g., full AI IDE, CLI, workflow-focused, etc.).

To organize your reasoning, use this formula:

> Answer = Sort( Filter( Union(Sources) ) )

You must conceptually follow these four stages:

1. **Sources → candidate list (per QUESTION)**
   - For each QUESTION from the `user:` section:
     - Search the web and relevant directories / launch pages.
     - Collect as many **candidate products** as are reasonably relevant.
   - For each candidate, internally track at least:
     - `name` (product name)
     - `url` (official homepage or primary landing page)
     - `description` (1–3 sentences in English summarizing what it does)
     - `sources` (which QUESTION(s) and which site(s) you saw it on)
   - At this stage you are allowed to over-collect; do **not** filter by date yet unless it is trivial.

2. **Union(candidates) → unified candidate set**
   - Merge candidates across all QUESTIONS into a single conceptual set:
     - Deduplicate products that clearly refer to the same thing
       (same URL, or obviously the same product name + branding).
   - After this step you have a unified **candidate pool**:
     - It may still contain old products, or products outside our domain.

3. **Filter(Union) → filtered candidate list**
   - For each product in the unified pool:
     - Investigate its **launch / first public release date** from credible public info
       (official site, launch post, Product Hunt / HN launch, blog, press, etc.).
     - Decide if it satisfies **both**:
       1) Launch date is within the last **14 days** (relative to “today”).
       2) Product is clearly related to **AI coding / code agents / IDE / dev workflows**.
   - If you cannot reasonably verify that the launch is within 14 days,
     **treat it as NOT valid** and exclude it.
   - Internally keep, for each surviving product:
     - `release_date` in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (best reasonable guess)
     - short one-line justification (do not put the justification in final YAML).

4. **Sort(filtered candidates) → final ordered list**
   - Only work with products that passed the filter.
   - Rank them by a simple mental score combining:
     - **recency** (more recent launch date is better),
     - **attention** (strong launch signal: PH upvotes, HN discussion, X/Reddit buzz),
     - **relevance** (how closely it fits “AI coding agent / IDE / devtool”).
   - You do not need to show the numeric score, just use it to order the list.


### Claude Code / todo-style planning requirements

When running inside Claude Code with access to a `todowrite` (or similar TODO-list) tool,
you MUST first externalize this plan as an explicit TODO list **before** doing any research.

Follow these rules:

0. Start with a planning item: add `Consider how to update todos based on products` as the very first TODO.

1. Based on the QUESTION list in the `user:` section, use the `todowrite` tool to create **one TODO item per QUESTION**.  
   - Each item should correspond to “Sources(QUESTION_i)” — i.e., collecting candidates for that QUESTION.

2. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Union** stage:  
   - e.g. “Union(all source results)” to merge candidates from all QUESTION-based source tasks.

3. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Filter** stage:  
   - e.g. “Filter(union) by launch date ≤ 14 days and AI coding relevance”.

4. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Sort** stage and final write-out:  
   - e.g. “Sort(filtered) and write result to result.yaml (or final-products.yaml)”.

A minimal example of the TODO list structure you are expected to build is (showing the alternating “record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” steps):

TODO List
- [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
...
- [ ] Union(sources from 1 to 3)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Write result to new-product.json
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

You may have more than 3 QUESTION-based source items (e.g. 7), but the pattern MUST be the same:
first all `Sources(QUESTION i)` items, then one `Union(...)`, one or more `Filter(...)` based on the number of unique products, one `Sort(...)`,
and finally one “write result” item.

You should use this TODO list as the execution plan and mark items as completed as you progress.

After all `Sources(QUESTION i)` tasks are done, you MUST rewrite the TODO list:
- Replace the generic filter items with one `Filter(<product name>)` per discovered product (the count of Filter items must equal the number of products).
- Keep `Sort(filtered)` and the final write step after those filter items.

Example refreshed TODO after finding 3 products:
TODO List
- [ ] Filter(Product Alpha)
- [ ] Filter(Product Beta)
- [ ] Filter(Product Gamma)
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Write result to result.yaml

**Progress logging pattern (few-shot)**
- After EVERY action item, add an explicit “Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” item (and mark it done once you rewrite and overwrite the file).
- This enforces a rhythm of: do a step → record progress → rewrite TODO → update `new-product.json` → next step.
- Sample pattern the model should mirror:
  - [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Union(all source results)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sort(filtered)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Write result to new-product.json
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

**Final output format (what you actually return):**

- Return a **JSON array** of products, sorted from most to least interesting.
- Each entry MUST have the following fields:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "name": "<product name>",
      "url": "<official homepage>",
      "description": "1–3 sentence summary of what this product does, focused on the developer / AI-coding use case.",
      "release_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "category": "<short label, e.g. \"AI IDE\", \"AI coding CLI\", \"code agent\", \"workflow agent\">",
      "sources": ["Product Hunt", "Show HN", "Reddit", "X"],
      "community_quotes": [
        "<short quote from community describing what people like or notice>",
        "<up to 5 quotes total, can be paraphrased but must reflect real feedback>"
      ]
    }
  ]
```

* Only include products that:

  * You have **good evidence** were launched in the last 14 days, and
  * Clearly belong to the **AI coding / developer tools** space.

* If you cannot find any products that satisfy the 14-day constraint,
  return an empty JSON array: `[]`.

Be concise, factual, and avoid marketing fluff. Do **not** include your reasoning text
in the final answer—only the JSON.

**File output + incremental updates requirement**
- Maintain a file named `new-product` in the current working directory.
- After every step (including each “Record progress, rewrite todo”), write the current JSON array to `new-product` (overwrite). Early steps may be partial/rough; later steps should be refined.
- The JSON must always be valid and reflect the best current view (start with `[]` if nothing yet).
- After the final step, ensure `new-product` holds the final sorted array.

## Working Directory Context

Your current working directory is: `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2026-01-08`

All file operations should be relative to this directory.

Below is your QUESTION list. For each QUESTION, treat it as a separate “research lens”
to discover newly launched AI coding products (global constraint: last 14 days).

1. QUESTION 1
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that position themselves as a “full AI IDE” (similar to Windsurf or Cursor), not just a small autocomplete plugin.

2. QUESTION 2
   List newly launched AI coding CLIs or terminal-based agents from the last 14 days that behave like Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, or Claude Code CLI (repo-aware, can run commands, can manage tasks).

3. QUESTION 5
   List newly launched AI tools from the last 14 days that focus on one specific developer workflow (for example debugging, refactoring, test generation, or migration) instead of being a general-purpose coding assistant.

4. QUESTION 7
   List newly launched AI code agents from the last 14 days that advertise “project-long memory” or “workspace memory” across multiple sessions (not just single-chat context).

5. QUESTION 11
   List newly launched open-source AI coding agents from the last 14 days that can be self-hosted or run locally by developers.

6. QUESTION 14
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that integrate directly into existing IDEs (such as VS Code, JetBrains, or Neovim) rather than being a standalone IDE.

7. QUESTION 16
   List newly launched AI agents from the last 14 days that help developers run or orchestrate complex workflows across tools (for example CI/CD, deployment, observability, or incident response), rather than only editing code.

[assistant message #2]
I'll help you research newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days. Let me start by creating a structured TODO list to organize this research systematically.

Here's what I found:\n\nThe search results don't specifically mention a new AI coding IDE with a release date in January 2026. However, there are several recent articles about AI coding tools and IDEs that were published around that time period:\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n1. **Windsurf by Codeium** - An AI-integrated development environment designed to enhance developer productivity through advanced AI features (mentioned in articles from early January 2026)\n\n2. **Google's Antigravity** - Launched with both a familiar IDE view and a revolutionary \"Manager View\" for orchestrating multiple AI agents (mentioned in trends articles from January 2026)\n\n3. **General AI IDE Trends for 2026:**\n   - Several articles discuss \"agentic IDEs\" that are evolving code editors into teammates\n   - The focus in 2026 appears to be on AI code review, multi-agent orchestration, and enhanced productivity\n   - Popular tools mentioned include Cursor, VS Code + Copilot, Continue, Tabby, Cody, Aider, and others\n\n**Note:** The search results show articles published in early January 2026 discussing AI coding trends and tools, but I don't see a specific announcement of a brand new IDE launch dated exactly January 2026. It's possible that:\n- Any new releases might not have been widely covered yet\n- The search may need more specific terms about a particular company or product name\n- There may not have been a major new IDE release in that specific month\n\nWould you like me to search for any specific AI coding IDE or company that you're interested in?\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

Here's what I found:\n\nThe search results don't specifically mention a new AI coding IDE with a release date in January 2026. However, there are several recent articles about AI coding tools and IDEs that were published around that time period:\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n1. **Windsurf by Codeium** - An AI-integrated development environment designed to enhance developer productivity through advanced AI features (mentioned in articles from early January 2026)\n\n2. **Google's Antigravity** - Launched with both a familiar IDE view and a revolutionary \"Manager View\" for orchestrating multiple AI agents (mentioned in trends articles from January 2026)\n\n3. **General AI IDE Trends for 2026:**\n   - Several articles discuss \"agentic IDEs\" that are evolving code editors into teammates\n   - The focus in 2026 appears to be on AI code review, multi-agent orchestration, and enhanced productivity\n   - Popular tools mentioned include Cursor, VS Code + Copilot, Continue, Tabby, Cody, Aider, and others\n\n**Note:** The search results show articles published in early January 2026 discussing AI coding trends and tools, but I don't see a specific announcement of a brand new IDE launch dated exactly January 2026. It's possible that:\n- Any new releases might not have been widely covered yet\n- The search may need more specific terms about a particular company or product name\n- There may not have been a major new IDE release in that specific month\n\nWould you like me to search for any specific AI coding IDE or company that you're interested in?"

Mentioned frequently across multiple articles\n   - Agent Skills were launched in October 2025 (noted in one result)\n   - Closely competes with GitHub Copilot and Cursor\n\n2. **OpenAI's Codex**\n   - Has a CLI tool mentioned\n   - One article mentions it \"pulled ahead\" in certain capabilities (as of Oct 2025)\n\n3. **Other Notable Agents**:\n   - Cursor\n   - GitHub Copilot\n   - Windsurf\n   - Bolt.new\n   - Amazon Q Developer\n   - Tabnine\n   - v0 by Vercel\n   - Replit AI\n\n### Interesting Finding:\nOne article from The Information (5 days ago) mentioned that **Microsoft has lost ground to tools like Cursor and Anthropic's Claude Code**, suggesting these newer competitors are challenging GitHub Copilot's dominance.\n\n### Clarification:\nSince we're currently in 2025, articles with \"January 2026\" in the title are likely **prediction pieces or state-of-the-industry articles** looking ahead to 2026, rather than reporting on actual launches that occurred in January 2026. The search results don't show any specific AI coding agent that launched in January 2026, as that month hasn't occurred yet.\n\nWould you like me to search for any specific AI coding agent or company, or would you prefer more recent information about AI coding tools that have actually launched?\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

However, here's what I found regarding the AI coding tool landscape around that timeframe:\n\n## Key Findings:\n\n### 1. **Kiro - AI IDE (Released July 2025)**\n- **Description**: A new AI IDE called \"Kiro\" was announced in July 2025\n- **Features**: Full AI coding experience with production-ready fundamentals\n- **Source**: [Introducing Kiro](https://kiro.dev/blog/introducing-kiro/)\n\n### 2. **Established AI Coding Tools Prominent in Late 2025:**\n- **Cursor** - An AI-native code editor with agent mode capabilities\n- **Windsurf** - Recognized as a Leader in the 2025 Gartner Magic Quadrant for AI Code Assistants\n- **GitHub Copilot** - Continued development and updates\n- **Zed** - AI-powered code editor\n- **Aider** - AI development tool\n- **Claude Code** - Developer tools by Anthropic with advanced tool use (announced November 2025)\n\n### 3. **JetBrains Junie (AI Coding Agent)**\n- **Status**: JetBrains introduced \"Junie\" as their AI coding agent\n- **Features**: Helps developers move faster, stay focused, and get more done\n- **Source**: [JetBrains Junie](https://www.jetbrains.com/junie/)\n\n### 4. **Qoder - Agentic Coding Platform**\n- **Description**: A platform featuring \"the world's latest and most advanced AI models\"\n- **Features**: Code completion, test generation, AI agent capabilities\n- **Platforms**: Windows, macOS, Linux\n- **Source**: [Qoder](https://qoder.com/)\n\n### 5. **IntelliJ IDEA 2025.3**\n- **Release**: JetBrains released IntelliJ IDEA 2025.3 with productivity enhancements\n- **Features**: Unified distribution, command completion, Spring debugger improvements\n\n### 6. **Eclipse IDE 2025-03**\n- **Release Date**: March 12, 2025\n- **Significance**: Marked a significant milestone in the platform's evolution\n\n## Notable Trends in Late 2025/Early 2026:\n\n- **Agentic AI**: A shift toward agent-first coding tools rather than just code completion\n- **OpenAI Codex**: Re-emerged in 2025 as a serious, agent-first coding tool\n- **AI-Generated Code**: By 2026, predictions indicated AI-generated code would dominate software development\n\n**Note**: Most major releases in the AI coding space appeared to occur earlier in 2025 (particularly in July and November), with December 2025 and January 2026 primarily featuring articles reviewing and ranking existing tools rather than announcing new releases.\n\nIf you're looking for information about a specific AI coding tool or IDE released after December 25, 2025, could you provide more details about what you're looking for? This would help me search more effectively.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

However, here's what I found regarding the AI coding tool landscape around that timeframe:\n\n## Key Findings:\n\n### 1. **Kiro - AI IDE (Released July 2025)**\n- **Description**: A new AI IDE called \"Kiro\" was announced in July 2025\n- **Features**: Full AI coding experience with production-ready fundamentals\n- **Source**: [Introducing Kiro](https://kiro.dev/blog/introducing-kiro/)\n\n### 2. **Established AI Coding Tools Prominent in Late 2025:**\n- **Cursor** - An AI-native code editor with agent mode capabilities\n- **Windsurf** - Recognized as a Leader in the 2025 Gartner Magic Quadrant for AI Code Assistants\n- **GitHub Copilot** - Continued development and updates\n- **Zed** - AI-powered code editor\n- **Aider** - AI development tool\n- **Claude Code** - Developer tools by Anthropic with advanced tool use (announced November 2025)\n\n### 3. **JetBrains Junie (AI Coding Agent)**\n- **Status**: JetBrains introduced \"Junie\" as their AI coding agent\n- **Features**: Helps developers move faster, stay focused, and get more done\n- **Source**: [JetBrains Junie](https://www.jetbrains.com/junie/)\n\n### 4. **Qoder - Agentic Coding Platform**\n- **Description**: A platform featuring \"the world's latest and most advanced AI models\"\n- **Features**: Code completion, test generation, AI agent capabilities\n- **Platforms**: Windows, macOS, Linux\n- **Source**: [Qoder](https://qoder.com/)\n\n### 5. **IntelliJ IDEA 2025.3**\n- **Release**: JetBrains released IntelliJ IDEA 2025.3 with productivity enhancements\n- **Features**: Unified distribution, command completion, Spring debugger improvements\n\n### 6. **Eclipse IDE 2025-03**\n- **Release Date**: March 12, 2025\n- **Significance**: Marked a significant milestone in the platform's evolution\n\n## Notable Trends in Late 2025/Early 2026:\n\n- **Agentic AI**: A shift toward agent-first coding tools rather than just code completion\n- **OpenAI Codex**: Re-emerged in 2025 as a serious, agent-first coding tool\n- **AI-Generated Code**: By 2026, predictions indicated AI-generated code would dominate software development\n\n**Note**: Most major releases in the AI coding space appeared to occur earlier in 2025 (particularly in July and November), with December 2025 and January 2026 primarily featuring articles reviewing and ranking existing tools rather than announcing new releases.\n\nIf you're looking for information about a specific AI coding tool or IDE released after December 25, 2025, could you provide more details about what you're looking for? This would help me search more effectively."

[assistant message #114]
Based on my comprehensive research, I found that **Visual Studio 2026 was released in November 2025**, which is outside the 14-day window (from January 8, 2026, looking back to December 25, 2025). For GitLab Duo Agent Platform, it's scheduled for GA in January 2026 but I need to verify if it's within the last 14 days.

Let me complete the analysis and prepare the final output:

[assistant message #121]
Based on my comprehensive research across all 7 questions (full AI IDEs, CLIs, workflow-specific tools, project memory agents, open-source agents, IDE-integrated tools, and workflow orchestration), I found that **no AI coding tools were launched in the last 14 days** (from January 8, 2026, looking back to December 25, 2025) that meet the criteria. 

The closest candidates were:
- **Visual Studio 2026** - Released November 2025 (outside 14-day window)
- **GitLab Duo Agent Platform** - Public beta announced, GA scheduled for January 2026 but specific GA date could not be confirmed as within last 14 days

Let me finalize the result:
