[system]
You are an AI research analyst specialized in AI developer tools:
code agents, AI IDEs, AI coding CLIs, and related devtools.

Your **global goal**:
- Find genuinely new products that have been publicly launched in the **last 14 days**
- AND that clearly target **programming / code / AI dev workflows**
- THEN summarize only the valid ones in a **clean YAML list**.

You MUST treat the questions in the `user:` section as your **research QUESTION list**.
Each QUESTION is a different “angle” on the same market (e.g., full AI IDE, CLI, workflow-focused, etc.).

To organize your reasoning, use this formula:

> Answer = Sort( Filter( Union(Sources) ) )

You must conceptually follow these four stages:

1. **Sources → candidate list (per QUESTION)**
   - For each QUESTION from the `user:` section:
     - Search the web and relevant directories / launch pages.
     - Collect as many **candidate products** as are reasonably relevant.
   - For each candidate, internally track at least:
     - `name` (product name)
     - `url` (official homepage or primary landing page)
     - `description` (1–3 sentences in English summarizing what it does)
     - `sources` (which QUESTION(s) and which site(s) you saw it on)
   - At this stage you are allowed to over-collect; do **not** filter by date yet unless it is trivial.

2. **Union(candidates) → unified candidate set**
   - Merge candidates across all QUESTIONS into a single conceptual set:
     - Deduplicate products that clearly refer to the same thing
       (same URL, or obviously the same product name + branding).
   - After this step you have a unified **candidate pool**:
     - It may still contain old products, or products outside our domain.

3. **Filter(Union) → filtered candidate list**
   - For each product in the unified pool:
     - Investigate its **launch / first public release date** from credible public info
       (official site, launch post, Product Hunt / HN launch, blog, press, etc.).
     - Decide if it satisfies **both**:
       1) Launch date is within the last **14 days** (relative to “today”).
       2) Product is clearly related to **AI coding / code agents / IDE / dev workflows**.
   - If you cannot reasonably verify that the launch is within 14 days,
     **treat it as NOT valid** and exclude it.
   - Internally keep, for each surviving product:
     - `release_date` in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (best reasonable guess)
     - short one-line justification (do not put the justification in final YAML).

4. **Sort(filtered candidates) → final ordered list**
   - Only work with products that passed the filter.
   - Rank them by a simple mental score combining:
     - **recency** (more recent launch date is better),
     - **attention** (strong launch signal: PH upvotes, HN discussion, X/Reddit buzz),
     - **relevance** (how closely it fits “AI coding agent / IDE / devtool”).
   - You do not need to show the numeric score, just use it to order the list.


### Claude Code / todo-style planning requirements

When running inside Claude Code with access to a `todowrite` (or similar TODO-list) tool,
you MUST first externalize this plan as an explicit TODO list **before** doing any research.

Follow these rules:

0. Start with a planning item: add `Consider how to update todos based on products` as the very first TODO.

1. Based on the QUESTION list in the `user:` section, use the `todowrite` tool to create **one TODO item per QUESTION**.  
   - Each item should correspond to “Sources(QUESTION_i)” — i.e., collecting candidates for that QUESTION.

2. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Union** stage:  
   - e.g. “Union(all source results)” to merge candidates from all QUESTION-based source tasks.

3. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Filter** stage:  
   - e.g. “Filter(union) by launch date ≤ 14 days and AI coding relevance”.

4. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Sort** stage and final write-out:  
   - e.g. “Sort(filtered) and write result to result.yaml (or final-products.yaml)”.

A minimal example of the TODO list structure you are expected to build is (showing the alternating “record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” steps):

TODO List
- [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
...
- [ ] Union(sources from 1 to 3)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Write result to new-product.json
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

You may have more than 3 QUESTION-based source items (e.g. 7), but the pattern MUST be the same:
first all `Sources(QUESTION i)` items, then one `Union(...)`, one or more `Filter(...)` based on the number of unique products, one `Sort(...)`,
and finally one “write result” item.

You should use this TODO list as the execution plan and mark items as completed as you progress.

After all `Sources(QUESTION i)` tasks are done, you MUST rewrite the TODO list:
- Replace the generic filter items with one `Filter(<product name>)` per discovered product (the count of Filter items must equal the number of products).
- Keep `Sort(filtered)` and the final write step after those filter items.

Example refreshed TODO after finding 3 products:
TODO List
- [ ] Filter(Product Alpha)
- [ ] Filter(Product Beta)
- [ ] Filter(Product Gamma)
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Write result to result.yaml

**Progress logging pattern (few-shot)**
- After EVERY action item, add an explicit “Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” item (and mark it done once you rewrite and overwrite the file).
- This enforces a rhythm of: do a step → record progress → rewrite TODO → update `new-product.json` → next step.
- Sample pattern the model should mirror:
  - [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Union(all source results)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sort(filtered)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Write result to new-product.json
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

**Final output format (what you actually return):**

- Return a **JSON array** of products, sorted from most to least interesting.
- Each entry MUST have the following fields:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "name": "<product name>",
      "url": "<official homepage>",
      "description": "1–3 sentence summary of what this product does, focused on the developer / AI-coding use case.",
      "release_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "category": "<short label, e.g. \"AI IDE\", \"AI coding CLI\", \"code agent\", \"workflow agent\">",
      "sources": ["Product Hunt", "Show HN", "Reddit", "X"],
      "community_quotes": [
        "<short quote from community describing what people like or notice>",
        "<up to 5 quotes total, can be paraphrased but must reflect real feedback>"
      ]
    }
  ]
```

* Only include products that:

  * You have **good evidence** were launched in the last 14 days, and
  * Clearly belong to the **AI coding / developer tools** space.

* If you cannot find any products that satisfy the 14-day constraint,
  return an empty JSON array: `[]`.

Be concise, factual, and avoid marketing fluff. Do **not** include your reasoning text
in the final answer—only the JSON.

**File output + incremental updates requirement**
- Maintain a file named `new-product` in the current working directory.
- After every step (including each “Record progress, rewrite todo”), write the current JSON array to `new-product` (overwrite). Early steps may be partial/rough; later steps should be refined.
- The JSON must always be valid and reflect the best current view (start with `[]` if nothing yet).
- After the final step, ensure `new-product` holds the final sorted array.

## Working Directory Context

Your current working directory is: `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2026-01-06`

All file operations should be relative to this directory.

Below is your QUESTION list. For each QUESTION, treat it as a separate “research lens”
to discover newly launched AI coding products (global constraint: last 14 days).

1. QUESTION 1
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that position themselves as a “full AI IDE” (similar to Windsurf or Cursor), not just a small autocomplete plugin.

2. QUESTION 2
   List newly launched AI coding CLIs or terminal-based agents from the last 14 days that behave like Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, or Claude Code CLI (repo-aware, can run commands, can manage tasks).

3. QUESTION 5
   List newly launched AI tools from the last 14 days that focus on one specific developer workflow (for example debugging, refactoring, test generation, or migration) instead of being a general-purpose coding assistant.

4. QUESTION 7
   List newly launched AI code agents from the last 14 days that advertise “project-long memory” or “workspace memory” across multiple sessions (not just single-chat context).

5. QUESTION 11
   List newly launched open-source AI coding agents from the last 14 days that can be self-hosted or run locally by developers.

6. QUESTION 14
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that integrate directly into existing IDEs (such as VS Code, JetBrains, or Neovim) rather than being a standalone IDE.

7. QUESTION 16
   List newly launched AI agents from the last 14 days that help developers run or orchestrate complex workflows across tools (for example CI/CD, deployment, observability, or incident response), rather than only editing code.

[assistant message #2]
I'll help you research newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days. Let me start by creating a TODO list to organize this research systematically.

This could mean:\n\n1. **No major launch occurred** in December 2025\n2. **The launch is too recent** to be indexed yet\n3. **The specific product name** wasn't included in your search query\n\n### Recommendations:\nTo find more specific information about a December 2025 AI IDE launch, you could try searching with:\n- A specific product name if you have one\n- Company names (e.g., \"Anthropic AI IDE December 2025\", \"OpenAI code editor launch\")\n- More recent date filters to capture very new announcements\n\nWould you like me to perform a more targeted search with any specific company or product name?\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

This could mean:\n\n1. **No major launch occurred** in December 2025\n2. **The launch is too recent** to be indexed yet\n3. **The specific product name** wasn't included in your search query\n\n### Recommendations:\nTo find more specific information about a December 2025 AI IDE launch, you could try searching with:\n- A specific product name if you have one\n- Company names (e.g., \"Anthropic AI IDE December 2025\", \"OpenAI code editor launch\")\n- More recent date filters to capture very new announcements\n\nWould you like me to perform a more targeted search with any specific company or product name?"

The major AI CLI tools had already been established earlier in 2025 (particularly in June and September), and the end-of-year period focused on evaluations and year-in-year-out reviews rather than new product launches.\n\nIf you're looking for a specific tool name or launch that I may have missed, could you provide additional details?\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

      "Based on my search, I could not find any specific AI CLI tool that was launched in **December 2025 or January 2026** as an alternative to Claude Code CLI, Gemini CLI, or Codex CLI.\n\nHere's what I found about the current AI CLI landscape:\n\n## Main AI CLI Tools (Launched Before December 2025)\n\n1. **Claude Code CLI** (Anthropic) - Enterprise-focused with security features\n2. **Gemini CLI** (Google) - Launched June 25, 2025; offers 1,000 free requests/day\n3. **Codex CLI** (OpenAI GPT-5-Codex) - Launched September 15, 2025; achieved 74.9% on SWE-bench Verified\n4. **OpenCode** - Open-source alternative that allows connecting any model provider\n\n## Recent Context (December 2025 - January 2026)\n\nThe search results show several **comparison articles and \"best of\" lists** published in December 2025 and January 2026 discussing these tools, but **no new CLI tool launches** during this period:\n\n- December 10, 2025: \"6 Best AI CLI Tools 2025\" article\n- December 17, 2025: \"AI Coding Tools in 2025: Welcome to the Agentic CLI Era\"\n- December 22, 2025: Comparison of Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, and Google Gemini CLI\n- January 2026: Multiple \"Best AI Tools for 2026\" articles\n\n## Possible Explanation\n\nIt appears that **December 2025 - January 2026** was a period of **consolidation and comparison** rather than new tool launches. The major AI CLI tools had already been established earlier in 2025 (particularly in June and September), and the end-of-year period focused on evaluations and year-in-year-out reviews rather than new product launches.\n\nIf you're looking for a specific tool name or launch that I may have missed, could you provide additional details?"

[assistant message #76]
Based on my comprehensive research across all 7 questions (full AI IDEs, CLI tools, workflow-specific tools, workspace memory tools, open-source agents, IDE-integrated tools, and orchestration agents), I must report that **I did not find any AI coding tools that were genuinely launched in the last 14 days (December 23, 2025 - January 6, 2026)**.

While I found extensive discussion about AI coding tools during this period, they were primarily:
- Review articles and "best of" lists for 2026
- Comparisons of existing tools (Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, etc.)
- Predictions and trend pieces for the coming year
- Updates to existing tools rather than new launches

The most recently launched tools I found were from earlier in 2025 (e.g., Gemini CLI in June 2025, Google Antigravity in November 2025, various testing tools throughout 2025).

Let me complete the research process and provide the final result:

## Research Summary

I have completed a comprehensive research investigation across all 7 question areas (AI IDEs, CLI tools, workflow-specific tools, workspace memory tools, open-source agents, IDE-integrated tools, and orchestration agents) for the period of December 23, 2025 - January 6, 2026.

### Key Findings:

**No new AI coding tool launches were found in the last 14 days.**

During this period, I found:
- Extensive "best of 2026" and year-end review articles
- Comparison pieces between existing tools (Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, etc.)
- Trend discussions and predictions for 2026
- Updates to existing tools

The most recently launched tools I discovered were from earlier in 2025:
- **Gemini CLI** (June 2025)
- **Google Antigravity** (November 2025)
- **Various testing tools** throughout 2025 (TestSprite, AgenticQA, Atla, etc.)

### Result:
Per the requirements, since no AI coding tools were genuinely launched in the last 14 days that meet the criteria, I am returning an empty array:

```json
[]
```

This result has been written to `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2026-01-06/new-product.json`.
