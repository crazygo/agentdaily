    "description": "Massive Hacker News discussion (400+ comments) on Claude Code and Opus 4.5 capabilities. Developers share experiences using agents to automate workflows: custom skills for UI libraries, ESLint automation, deep code review agents, PR review automation, ticket triage, doc syncing, and E2E coverage checks. Discussion reveals split: some report 10-100x productivity gains and 'vibe coding' entire applications without opening source files, others struggle with context limitations and complex domains. Zed team reports 99% of Rust code is now AI-generated. Debate over whether AI is 'next tier' or requires same workarounds as previous models.",

He describes the profession being 'dramatically refactored' with programmers contributing increasingly sparse bits between AI agents, subagents, prompts, contexts, memory, modes, permissions, tools, and plugins. He calls this a 'magnitude 9 earthquake' rocking the profession and urges developers to 'roll up your sleeves to not fall behind.'",
