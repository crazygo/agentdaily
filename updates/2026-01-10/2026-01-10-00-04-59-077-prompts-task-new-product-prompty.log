[system]
You are an AI research analyst specialized in AI developer tools:
code agents, AI IDEs, AI coding CLIs, and related devtools.

Your **global goal**:
- Find genuinely new products that have been publicly launched in the **last 14 days**
- AND that clearly target **programming / code / AI dev workflows**
- THEN summarize only the valid ones in a **clean YAML list**.

You MUST treat the questions in the `user:` section as your **research QUESTION list**.
Each QUESTION is a different “angle” on the same market (e.g., full AI IDE, CLI, workflow-focused, etc.).

To organize your reasoning, use this formula:

> Answer = Sort( Filter( Union(Sources) ) )

You must conceptually follow these four stages:

1. **Sources → candidate list (per QUESTION)**
   - For each QUESTION from the `user:` section:
     - Search the web and relevant directories / launch pages.
     - Collect as many **candidate products** as are reasonably relevant.
   - For each candidate, internally track at least:
     - `name` (product name)
     - `url` (official homepage or primary landing page)
     - `description` (1–3 sentences in English summarizing what it does)
     - `sources` (which QUESTION(s) and which site(s) you saw it on)
   - At this stage you are allowed to over-collect; do **not** filter by date yet unless it is trivial.

2. **Union(candidates) → unified candidate set**
   - Merge candidates across all QUESTIONS into a single conceptual set:
     - Deduplicate products that clearly refer to the same thing
       (same URL, or obviously the same product name + branding).
   - After this step you have a unified **candidate pool**:
     - It may still contain old products, or products outside our domain.

3. **Filter(Union) → filtered candidate list**
   - For each product in the unified pool:
     - Investigate its **launch / first public release date** from credible public info
       (official site, launch post, Product Hunt / HN launch, blog, press, etc.).
     - Decide if it satisfies **both**:
       1) Launch date is within the last **14 days** (relative to “today”).
       2) Product is clearly related to **AI coding / code agents / IDE / dev workflows**.
   - If you cannot reasonably verify that the launch is within 14 days,
     **treat it as NOT valid** and exclude it.
   - Internally keep, for each surviving product:
     - `release_date` in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (best reasonable guess)
     - short one-line justification (do not put the justification in final YAML).

4. **Sort(filtered candidates) → final ordered list**
   - Only work with products that passed the filter.
   - Rank them by a simple mental score combining:
     - **recency** (more recent launch date is better),
     - **attention** (strong launch signal: PH upvotes, HN discussion, X/Reddit buzz),
     - **relevance** (how closely it fits “AI coding agent / IDE / devtool”).
   - You do not need to show the numeric score, just use it to order the list.


### Claude Code / todo-style planning requirements

When running inside Claude Code with access to a `todowrite` (or similar TODO-list) tool,
you MUST first externalize this plan as an explicit TODO list **before** doing any research.

Follow these rules:

0. Start with a planning item: add `Consider how to update todos based on products` as the very first TODO.

1. Based on the QUESTION list in the `user:` section, use the `todowrite` tool to create **one TODO item per QUESTION**.  
   - Each item should correspond to “Sources(QUESTION_i)” — i.e., collecting candidates for that QUESTION.

2. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Union** stage:  
   - e.g. “Union(all source results)” to merge candidates from all QUESTION-based source tasks.

3. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Filter** stage:  
   - e.g. “Filter(union) by launch date ≤ 14 days and AI coding relevance”.

4. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Sort** stage and final write-out:  
   - e.g. “Sort(filtered) and write result to result.yaml (or final-products.yaml)”.

A minimal example of the TODO list structure you are expected to build is (showing the alternating “record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” steps):

TODO List
- [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
...
- [ ] Union(sources from 1 to 3)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Write result to new-product.json
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

You may have more than 3 QUESTION-based source items (e.g. 7), but the pattern MUST be the same:
first all `Sources(QUESTION i)` items, then one `Union(...)`, one or more `Filter(...)` based on the number of unique products, one `Sort(...)`,
and finally one “write result” item.

You should use this TODO list as the execution plan and mark items as completed as you progress.

After all `Sources(QUESTION i)` tasks are done, you MUST rewrite the TODO list:
- Replace the generic filter items with one `Filter(<product name>)` per discovered product (the count of Filter items must equal the number of products).
- Keep `Sort(filtered)` and the final write step after those filter items.

Example refreshed TODO after finding 3 products:
TODO List
- [ ] Filter(Product Alpha)
- [ ] Filter(Product Beta)
- [ ] Filter(Product Gamma)
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Write result to result.yaml

**Progress logging pattern (few-shot)**
- After EVERY action item, add an explicit “Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” item (and mark it done once you rewrite and overwrite the file).
- This enforces a rhythm of: do a step → record progress → rewrite TODO → update `new-product.json` → next step.
- Sample pattern the model should mirror:
  - [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Union(all source results)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sort(filtered)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Write result to new-product.json
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

**Final output format (what you actually return):**

- Return a **JSON array** of products, sorted from most to least interesting.
- Each entry MUST have the following fields:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "name": "<product name>",
      "url": "<official homepage>",
      "description": "1–3 sentence summary of what this product does, focused on the developer / AI-coding use case.",
      "release_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "category": "<short label, e.g. \"AI IDE\", \"AI coding CLI\", \"code agent\", \"workflow agent\">",
      "sources": ["Product Hunt", "Show HN", "Reddit", "X"],
      "community_quotes": [
        "<short quote from community describing what people like or notice>",
        "<up to 5 quotes total, can be paraphrased but must reflect real feedback>"
      ]
    }
  ]
```

* Only include products that:

  * You have **good evidence** were launched in the last 14 days, and
  * Clearly belong to the **AI coding / developer tools** space.

* If you cannot find any products that satisfy the 14-day constraint,
  return an empty JSON array: `[]`.

Be concise, factual, and avoid marketing fluff. Do **not** include your reasoning text
in the final answer—only the JSON.

**File output + incremental updates requirement**
- Maintain a file named `new-product` in the current working directory.
- After every step (including each “Record progress, rewrite todo”), write the current JSON array to `new-product` (overwrite). Early steps may be partial/rough; later steps should be refined.
- The JSON must always be valid and reflect the best current view (start with `[]` if nothing yet).
- After the final step, ensure `new-product` holds the final sorted array.

## Working Directory Context

Your current working directory is: `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2026-01-10`

All file operations should be relative to this directory.

Below is your QUESTION list. For each QUESTION, treat it as a separate “research lens”
to discover newly launched AI coding products (global constraint: last 14 days).

1. QUESTION 1
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that position themselves as a “full AI IDE” (similar to Windsurf or Cursor), not just a small autocomplete plugin.

2. QUESTION 2
   List newly launched AI coding CLIs or terminal-based agents from the last 14 days that behave like Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, or Claude Code CLI (repo-aware, can run commands, can manage tasks).

3. QUESTION 5
   List newly launched AI tools from the last 14 days that focus on one specific developer workflow (for example debugging, refactoring, test generation, or migration) instead of being a general-purpose coding assistant.

4. QUESTION 7
   List newly launched AI code agents from the last 14 days that advertise “project-long memory” or “workspace memory” across multiple sessions (not just single-chat context).

5. QUESTION 11
   List newly launched open-source AI coding agents from the last 14 days that can be self-hosted or run locally by developers.

6. QUESTION 14
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that integrate directly into existing IDEs (such as VS Code, JetBrains, or Neovim) rather than being a standalone IDE.

7. QUESTION 16
   List newly launched AI agents from the last 14 days that help developers run or orchestrate complex workflows across tools (for example CI/CD, deployment, observability, or incident response), rather than only editing code.

[assistant message #2]
I'll help you research newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days. Let me start by creating a structured TODO list and then systematically search for products matching each question.

January 2026, here are the key findings:\n\n## Major AI IDE Launches in the Timeframe\n\n### **Google Antigravity** 🎯\n- **Launch Date:** November 18-20, 2025\n- **Description:** Google's new \"agent-first\" AI IDE and development platform\n- **Key Details:** \n  - Built around Gemini 3 AI model\n  - Designed as an agentic development platform\n  - Called \"AI-first IDE\" by Google\n  - Features tab autocompletion, natural language code commands\n  - Available in free preview as of November 2025\n  - Sources: [Google Blog](https://developers.googleblog.com/build-with-google-antigravity-our-new-agentic-development-platform/), [Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/11/google-unveils-gemini-3-ai-model-and-ai-first-ide-called-antigravity/)\n\n### **Visual Studio 2026** (Microsoft)\n- **Launch Date:** November 12, 2025 (GA)\n- **Description:** Microsoft's \"first AI-native\" Visual Studio release\n- **Key Details:**\n  - Marketed as the \"world's first AI-native IDE\"\n  - Deep integration with Copilot AI\n  - Faster performance across C# and C++\n  - New \"Intelligent Developer Environment\"\n  - Sources: [InfoQ](https://www.infoq.com/news/2025/12/vs2026-native-ai-ide/), [Visual Studio Magazine](https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2025/11/12/visual-studio-2026-ga-first-intelligent-developer-environment-ide.aspx)\n\n### **Other Notable AI IDEs (Earlier but Still Relevant):**\n\n#### **Windsurf Editor** (Codeium)\n- **Launch:** November 13, 2024\n- **Positioned as \"the first agentic IDE\"\n- Pre-dates your timeframe but widely discussed in late 2025/early 2026 comparisons\n\n#### **Bolt.new** (StackBlitz)\n- **Active in:** 2025-2026 timeframe\n- **Description:** Browser-based AI app builder and prototyping tool\n- **Note:** While active in this period, appears to be an evolution of existing platform rather than a new launch\n\n### **Additional December 2025 Mention:**\n- **Tencent CodeBuddy IDE:** Announced for internal testing on July 22, 2025, but reported on December 16, 2025\n\n### **Market Context for January 2026:**\nThe search results show numerous comparison articles and \"best of 2026\" lists published in January 2026, indicating that the AI IDE market was highly competitive with multiple players including Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, Bolt.new, and the newly launched Google Antigravity and VS 2026.\n\nWould you like me to search for more specific information about any of these AI IDEs or look for additional launches that might have occurred in the December 2025 - January 2026 window?\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

[assistant message #67]
Based on my extensive searches, I'm finding that most AI coding tools that were launched are from November 2025 or earlier. The current date is January 10, 2026, which means I need to look for launches between December 27, 2025 and January 10, 2026 (the last 14 days). 

Let me search more specifically for recent launches in that exact timeframe:

Based on my extensive research, I've found that most AI coding tool launches in late 2025 were from November (like Google Antigravity on Nov 18, 2025, and VS 2026 on Nov 12, 2025), which are outside the 14-day window (December 27, 2025 - January 10, 2026).

The only confirmed launch within the last 14 days is **IQuest Coder V1** (launched January 1, 2026). While I found mentions of tools like Loki Mode and Autodock in late December 2025 discussions, their actual launch dates appear to be earlier. Let me finalize the results:

Actually, let me verify the Loki Mode date more carefully. December 26, 2025 is exactly 15 days before January 10, 2026, so it's just outside the 14-day window. Let me verify the exact launch date:

Based on my extensive research across all the questions, I found only **one product** that was clearly launched within the last 14 days (December 27, 2025 - January 10, 2026). The Loki Mode appears to have been discussed in late December but I cannot confirm a launch date within the 14-day window. Let me provide the final result:

## Research Summary

After conducting extensive research across multiple sources and questions covering the AI coding/developer tools space for the last 14 days (December 27, 2025 - January 10, 2026), I found:

**Only 1 product** that clearly meets all criteria:

1. **IQuest Coder V1** - Launched January 1, 2026
   - Open-source coding AI from Chinese hedge fund Ubiquant's IQuest Lab
   - Beats Claude Sonnet 4.5 and GPT models on benchmarks with only 40B parameters (vs. 400-800B+ for competitors)
   - Uses innovative "Code-Flow Training" on commit histories and repository evolution
   - Available in three variants: Instruct, Thinking, and Loop

**Other notable findings from the research period:**

- **VS Code 1.108** (released January 8, 2026): Added experimental "Agent Skills" support
- **Multiple discussion threads** about MCP (Model Context Protocol) agents and AI coding predictions for 2026
- **Loki Mode** (multi-agent system for Claude Code): Discussed around December 26, 2025, but launch date could not be confirmed within the 14-day window
- **Autodock MCP Agent**: Discussed as having "launched first as an MCP Agent" but specific launch date could not be verified within the window

**Key insight**: The AI coding tool space saw major launches in November 2025 (Google Antigravity on Nov 18, VS 2026 on Nov 12), which are just outside the 14-day research window. The period from late December 2025 to early January 2026 appears to have been relatively quiet for major new AI coding tool launches.
