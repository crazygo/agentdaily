You are an AI research analyst focused on AI coding thought leadership. Track recent insights with disciplined TODO planning and continuous file updates.
Global goal:
- Find technical insights/opinions/discussions in the **last 7 days** from the provided thought leaders and sources.
- Return a clean JSON array of insights, sorted by recency/relevance.
- Keep `insights.json` valid and updated after every step (start with `[]` if empty).
### TODO planning rules
- Start with `Consider how to update todos based on insights`.
- Create one `Sources(<leader/source>)` item per thought leader (and any extra sources you add).
- After each action, add and complete: `Record progress, rewrite todo, update insights.json`.
- After all Sources are done, rewrite the TODO list so Filters are per insight found (one `Filter(<insight title or source>)` per insight), then include `Sort(filtered)` and `Write result to insights.json`.
Sample TODO rhythm to mirror:
- [ ] Consider how to update todos based on insights
- [ ] Sources(Andrej Karpathy)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update insights.json
- [ ] Sources(Simon Willison)

## Working Directory Context

Your current working directory is: `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2026-01-10`

All file operations should be relative to this directory.

---

**Today's Date**: {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE}
**Date Range**: {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE} minus 7 days = {INSERT_START_DATE}
**IMPORTANT TIME CONSTRAINTS**:
- Only include content published/posted between {INSERT_START_DATE} and {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE}
- When searching, ALWAYS use date filters: "after:{INSERT_START_DATE} before:{INSERT_CURRENT_DATE}" or equivalent date range syntax
- For Twitter/X: Use advanced search with date range filters
- For Google/Blog searches: Use "after:{INSERT_START_DATE}" or site-specific date filters
- For Hacker News/Reddit: Filter by time period (past week) or use date-based search
- For YouTube: Use upload date filter (last 7 days)
- **CRITICAL**: If a source does not have a clear publication date within the 7-day window, EXCLUDE it from results
- Verify publication dates before including in insights.json

Output format (JSON array):
```json
[
  {
    "title": "Headline or discussion topic",
    "description": "Summary of key points and takeaways",
    "author": "Who wrote or said it",
    "source": "Blog | Twitter | YouTube | Podcast | TechMedia | HN | Reddit | Paper | Platform",
    "url": "https://link-to-content",
    "published_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "topics": ["Relevant", "Tags", "Here"],
    "type": "technical | opinion | tutorial | discussion"
  }
]
```
- **Date validation**: Each insight MUST include a `published_date` field, and it MUST be within the 7-day window ({INSERT_START_DATE} to {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE})
- If no valid insights in the 7-day window, return `[]`.
File output + incremental updates:
- Maintain `insights.json` in the current working directory.
- After every step (including each "Record progress, rewrite todo"), overwrite `insights.json` with the best current JSON (start with `[]` if nothing yet).
- **Before writing to insights.json**: Verify that each insight's `published_date` is within the 7-day window. Remove any insights outside this range.
- Final state must hold the sorted array of insights (sorted by date, most recent first).

[assistant message #2]
I'll help you gather AI coding insights from the last 7 days. Let me start by setting up the TODO list and then systematically search through each source.

The posts found are from various time periods ranging from 7 years ago to 4 months ago.\n\n### Key Results from r/MachineLearning:\n\n1. **[D] What is more Important loss or accuracy?** (2 years ago)\n   - Discussion on whether accuracy or loss should be the primary optimization metric\n\n2. **[D] Is there a more systematic way of choosing the layers or...** (1 year ago)\n   - About selecting appropriate layers in deep learning and neural networks\n\n3. **[D] Do people erroneously use the term \"generative\" or is...** (4 years ago)\n   - Examining terminology around generative models and text generation\n\n4. **[D] model architecture or data?** (4 months ago)\n   - Discussion on the relative importance of model architecture versus data quality\n\n5. **[D] Why do machine learning papers have such terrible...** (7 years ago)\n   - Critique of mathematical notation in ML research papers\n\n6. **Can Machine Learning Truly 'Generalize'—Or Are We Just...** (10 months ago)\n   - Philosophical discussion on ML generalization capabilities\n\n### Observations:\n- **No results were found from r/artificial or r/programming**\n- **No posts specifically discussing predictions or developments for 2026**\n- The search didn't capture current discussions about AI coding assistants or LLMs in the context of future developments\n\nThe results suggest that either:\n1. There haven't been significant discussions about 2026-specific AI/LLM predictions on these subreddits yet, or\n2. The specific combination of search terms may need to be adjusted to capture more relevant content"

## Summary

I've successfully gathered AI coding insights from the last 7 days (January 3-10, 2026) and compiled them into `insights.json`. Here's what I found:

### Key Insights Collected:

1. **Hacker News (Jan 9)** - Massive discussion on Claude Code/Opus 4.5 with 400+ comments. Developers sharing agent automation workflows (skills, ESLint automation, PR reviews, ticket triage). Reports of 10-100x productivity gains vs. struggles with context limitations.

2. **Simon Willison (Jan 8)** - LLM predictions for 2026 on Oxide and Friends podcast covering future trajectory of AI development.

3. **Amjad Masad/Replit (Jan 7)** - $3B valuation profile discussing "vibe coding" prototypes and how product managers are becoming "vibe coders."

4. **Hacker News Discussion (Jan 7)** - Debate on Addy Osmani's LLM workflow, questioning real productivity gains vs. hype, with references to METR study showing 19% productivity decrease.

5. **LMArena (Jan 6)** - $1.7B valuation after 4 months, showing enterprise adoption of AI coding tools like Claude Code.

6. **Shakudo (Jan 6)** - Top 9 LLMs overview for January 2026.

7. **YouTube (Jan 5)** - AI trends in 2026 marking a "major turning point."

8. **Andrej Karpathy (Jan 4)** - Feeling overwhelmed by AI changes, calling it a "magnitude 9 earthquake" rocking the profession.

### Removed:
- Addy Osmani's blog post (Dec 19, 2025) - outside the 7-day window

All insights are now sorted by date (most recent first) and saved to `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2026-01-10/insights.json`.
