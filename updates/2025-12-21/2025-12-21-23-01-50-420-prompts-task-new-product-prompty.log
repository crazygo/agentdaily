[system]
You are an AI research analyst specialized in AI developer tools:
code agents, AI IDEs, AI coding CLIs, and related devtools.

Your **global goal**:
- Find genuinely new products that have been publicly launched in the **last 14 days**
- AND that clearly target **programming / code / AI dev workflows**
- THEN summarize only the valid ones in a **clean YAML list**.

You MUST treat the questions in the `user:` section as your **research QUESTION list**.
Each QUESTION is a different “angle” on the same market (e.g., full AI IDE, CLI, workflow-focused, etc.).

To organize your reasoning, use this formula:

> Answer = Sort( Filter( Union(Sources) ) )

You must conceptually follow these four stages:

1. **Sources → candidate list (per QUESTION)**
   - For each QUESTION from the `user:` section:
     - Search the web and relevant directories / launch pages.
     - Collect as many **candidate products** as are reasonably relevant.
   - For each candidate, internally track at least:
     - `name` (product name)
     - `url` (official homepage or primary landing page)
     - `description` (1–3 sentences in English summarizing what it does)
     - `sources` (which QUESTION(s) and which site(s) you saw it on)
   - At this stage you are allowed to over-collect; do **not** filter by date yet unless it is trivial.

2. **Union(candidates) → unified candidate set**
   - Merge candidates across all QUESTIONS into a single conceptual set:
     - Deduplicate products that clearly refer to the same thing
       (same URL, or obviously the same product name + branding).
   - After this step you have a unified **candidate pool**:
     - It may still contain old products, or products outside our domain.

3. **Filter(Union) → filtered candidate list**
   - For each product in the unified pool:
     - Investigate its **launch / first public release date** from credible public info
       (official site, launch post, Product Hunt / HN launch, blog, press, etc.).
     - Decide if it satisfies **both**:
       1) Launch date is within the last **14 days** (relative to “today”).
       2) Product is clearly related to **AI coding / code agents / IDE / dev workflows**.
   - If you cannot reasonably verify that the launch is within 14 days,
     **treat it as NOT valid** and exclude it.
   - Internally keep, for each surviving product:
     - `release_date` in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (best reasonable guess)
     - short one-line justification (do not put the justification in final YAML).

4. **Sort(filtered candidates) → final ordered list**
   - Only work with products that passed the filter.
   - Rank them by a simple mental score combining:
     - **recency** (more recent launch date is better),
     - **attention** (strong launch signal: PH upvotes, HN discussion, X/Reddit buzz),
     - **relevance** (how closely it fits “AI coding agent / IDE / devtool”).
   - You do not need to show the numeric score, just use it to order the list.


### Claude Code / todo-style planning requirements

When running inside Claude Code with access to a `todowrite` (or similar TODO-list) tool,
you MUST first externalize this plan as an explicit TODO list **before** doing any research.

Follow these rules:

0. Start with a planning item: add `Consider how to update todos based on products` as the very first TODO.

1. Based on the QUESTION list in the `user:` section, use the `todowrite` tool to create **one TODO item per QUESTION**.  
   - Each item should correspond to “Sources(QUESTION_i)” — i.e., collecting candidates for that QUESTION.

2. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Union** stage:  
   - e.g. “Union(all source results)” to merge candidates from all QUESTION-based source tasks.

3. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Filter** stage:  
   - e.g. “Filter(union) by launch date ≤ 14 days and AI coding relevance”.

4. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Sort** stage and final write-out:  
   - e.g. “Sort(filtered) and write result to result.yaml (or final-products.yaml)”.

A minimal example of the TODO list structure you are expected to build is (showing the alternating “record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” steps):

TODO List
- [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
...
- [ ] Union(sources from 1 to 3)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Write result to new-product.json
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

You may have more than 3 QUESTION-based source items (e.g. 7), but the pattern MUST be the same:
first all `Sources(QUESTION i)` items, then one `Union(...)`, one or more `Filter(...)` based on the number of unique products, one `Sort(...)`,
and finally one “write result” item.

You should use this TODO list as the execution plan and mark items as completed as you progress.

After all `Sources(QUESTION i)` tasks are done, you MUST rewrite the TODO list:
- Replace the generic filter items with one `Filter(<product name>)` per discovered product (the count of Filter items must equal the number of products).
- Keep `Sort(filtered)` and the final write step after those filter items.

Example refreshed TODO after finding 3 products:
TODO List
- [ ] Filter(Product Alpha)
- [ ] Filter(Product Beta)
- [ ] Filter(Product Gamma)
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Write result to result.yaml

**Progress logging pattern (few-shot)**
- After EVERY action item, add an explicit “Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” item (and mark it done once you rewrite and overwrite the file).
- This enforces a rhythm of: do a step → record progress → rewrite TODO → update `new-product.json` → next step.
- Sample pattern the model should mirror:
  - [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Union(all source results)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sort(filtered)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Write result to new-product.json
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

**Final output format (what you actually return):**

- Return a **JSON array** of products, sorted from most to least interesting.
- Each entry MUST have the following fields:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "name": "<product name>",
      "url": "<official homepage>",
      "description": "1–3 sentence summary of what this product does, focused on the developer / AI-coding use case.",
      "release_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "category": "<short label, e.g. \"AI IDE\", \"AI coding CLI\", \"code agent\", \"workflow agent\">",
      "sources": ["Product Hunt", "Show HN", "Reddit", "X"],
      "community_quotes": [
        "<short quote from community describing what people like or notice>",
        "<up to 5 quotes total, can be paraphrased but must reflect real feedback>"
      ]
    }
  ]
```

* Only include products that:

  * You have **good evidence** were launched in the last 14 days, and
  * Clearly belong to the **AI coding / developer tools** space.

* If you cannot find any products that satisfy the 14-day constraint,
  return an empty JSON array: `[]`.

Be concise, factual, and avoid marketing fluff. Do **not** include your reasoning text
in the final answer—only the JSON.

**File output + incremental updates requirement**
- Maintain a file named `new-product` in the current working directory.
- After every step (including each “Record progress, rewrite todo”), write the current JSON array to `new-product` (overwrite). Early steps may be partial/rough; later steps should be refined.
- The JSON must always be valid and reflect the best current view (start with `[]` if nothing yet).
- After the final step, ensure `new-product` holds the final sorted array.

## Working Directory Context

Your current working directory is: `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2025-12-21`

All file operations should be relative to this directory.

---

Below is your QUESTION list. For each QUESTION, treat it as a separate “research lens”
to discover newly launched AI coding products (global constraint: last 14 days).

1. QUESTION 1
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that position themselves as a “full AI IDE” (similar to Windsurf or Cursor), not just a small autocomplete plugin.

2. QUESTION 2
   List newly launched AI coding CLIs or terminal-based agents from the last 14 days that behave like Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, or Claude Code CLI (repo-aware, can run commands, can manage tasks).

3. QUESTION 5
   List newly launched AI tools from the last 14 days that focus on one specific developer workflow (for example debugging, refactoring, test generation, or migration) instead of being a general-purpose coding assistant.

4. QUESTION 7
   List newly launched AI code agents from the last 14 days that advertise “project-long memory” or “workspace memory” across multiple sessions (not just single-chat context).

5. QUESTION 11
   List newly launched open-source AI coding agents from the last 14 days that can be self-hosted or run locally by developers.

6. QUESTION 14
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that integrate directly into existing IDEs (such as VS Code, JetBrains, or Neovim) rather than being a standalone IDE.

7. QUESTION 16
   List newly launched AI agents from the last 14 days that help developers run or orchestrate complex workflows across tools (for example CI/CD, deployment, observability, or incident response), rather than only editing code.

[assistant message #2]
I'll help you research newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days. Let me start by creating a structured TODO list to organize this research systematically.

Here's what I discovered:\n\n## Windsurf AI IDE Launch Details\n\n**Key Finding:** The Windsurf AI IDE actually launched in **November 2024**, not December 2024.\n\n### Platform Launch Coverage:\n\n**1. Reddit:**\n- **Post**: \"Introducing Windsurf - The first agentic IDE, and then some\"\n- **Date**: November 14, 2024\n- **Link**: https://www.reddit.com/r/Codeium/comments/1gqr21i/introducing_windsurf_the_first_agentic_ide_and/\n\n**2.

Product Hunt:**\n- **Listing**: \"Windsurf: The first agentic IDE. Tomorrow's editor, today.\"\n- **Link**: https://www.producthunt.com/products/windsurf\n\n### About Windsurf:\n- **Built by**: Codeium team\n- **Description**: The first truly \"agentic IDE\" with a collaborative agent called \"Cascade\" that has deep codebase understanding\n- **Key Feature**: Can seamlessly edit multiple files in unison, allowing creation of routes, views, models, and templates in one operation\n\n### Timeline Clarification:\nAccording to search results, Codeium launched the Windsurf Editor on **November 13, 2024**, with the public launch occurring on **November 21, 2024**.\n\nThere wasn't a major December 2024 launch announcement found, as the product had already launched in November. However, there were some mentions of updates and discussions about Windsurf throughout December 2024 in various tech publications and developer communities.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

      "Based on my web search for new AI IDEs launched, released, or announced in December 2024, here are the key findings:\n\n## Windsurf Editor by Codeium\n\nThe most significant AI IDE launch from that timeframe was **Windsurf Editor** by Codeium, which was officially launched in **November 2024** (right before your December 2024 timeframe). This appears to be the major new AI IDE launch relevant to your search criteria.\n\n### Key Details:\n- **Launch Date**: November 2024 (announced in December 2024 updates)\n- **Developer**: Codeium\n- **Description**: Described as \"the first AI-native IDE\" and \"the first truly agentic IDE\"\n- **Features**: \n  - Built around an AI engine\n  - Includes a collaborative agent called \"Cascade\" with deep codebase understanding\n  - Offers Pro tier with User Prompt credits and Flow Action credits\n  - Designed to be enterprise-focused\n\n### Additional Context:\n- Windsurf aims to be a transformative new era in AI coding tools\n- It combines collaborative features with AI assistance\n- The IDE was built from the ground up to support complex agentic coding workflows\n- It's positioned as competing with other AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and others\n\n## Other Findings:\nWhile I found general information about AI coding tools and IDEs from late 2024, **Windsurf Editor by Codeium appears to be the primary new AI IDE launch that aligns with your December 2024 search timeframe**. Most other results were updates to existing AI tools rather than entirely new IDE launches.\n\nThe search didn't reveal any other completely new AI IDEs specifically launched in December 2024, though there were various updates and announcements for existing AI coding assistants and development tools during that period."

However, I found several significant developments in the AI CLI space around that time period and early 2025:\n\n## Key Findings:\n\n### December 2024 Developments:\n- **GitHub Copilot Free Tier**: GitHub launched a free tier of GitHub Copilot in December 2024, making AI coding assistance more accessible to developers.

[assistant message #35]
Based on my searches for AI coding CLI tools launched in December 2024, I found one significant development:

## **Google Jules - AI Coding Agent**

**Key Finding:** Google announced **Jules** in **December 2024**, an AI coding agent designed to help developers fix buggy code.

### Launch Details:
- **Date:** December 11, 2024
- **Developer:** Google
- **Type:** AI coding agent with CLI capabilities
- **Focus:** Asynchronous coding agent for debugging and code repair

### Key Features:
- **Debugging Focus**: Specifically designed to help developers identify and fix buggy code
- **Asynchronous Operation**: Works asynchronously with developers to provide code fixes
- **Integration**: Part of Google's broader Gemini 2.0 ecosystem
- **API & Command Line**: Available through both API and command-line interfaces
- **Free Access**: Google made Jules available to everyone with both free and paid plans

### Market Context:
- Positioned as Google's entry into the AI coding assistant market
- Competes with tools like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and other AI coding agents
- Launched as part of Google's broader push into developer-focused AI tools

However, it's important to note that while Jules was announced in December 2024, its full public rollout occurred in **August 2025** according to the search results. The December 2024 announcement was more of a preview/announcement phase.

### Other Context:
The search results also mention various existing AI CLI tools that gained prominence during this period but weren't specifically launched in December 2024, including:
- GitHub Copilot CLI (existing but expanded functionality)
- Claude Code (Anthropic's CLI tool)
- Aider (open-source AI coding assistant)

The results included:\n\n- **GitHub Copilot** - consistently mentioned as the industry standard\n- **Tabnine** - AI code completion tool\n- **Qodo (formerly CodiumAI)** - mentioned for test generation and debugging\n- **Cursor** - AI-powered code editor\n- **Windsurf** - AI development tool\n- **Zed** - AI-enhanced code editor\n- **Aider** - AI coding assistant\n- **Refraction** - AI code generation and refactoring tool\n\n**Possible Reasons for Limited Results:**\n1. The specific December 2024 timeframe may be too recent for tools to have gained significant online presence\n2. The combination of all those specific features (debugging + refactoring + test generation + migration) may be quite rare in a single tool\n3. Tools may have been launched but not yet widely covered in search results or indexed\n\n**Suggestions:**\n- You might want to try searching for tools that launched in late 2024 with a more flexible date range\n- Consider looking for tools that specialize in 1-2 of the features you mentioned rather than all of them\n- Check Product Hunt's archives directly for December 2024 launches\n- Monitor tech news sources and developer communities for recent AI tool announcements\n\nWould you like me to try a broader search with modified parameters, or are you looking for information about a specific tool you already know about?\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

      "Based on my web search, I was unable to find any specific AI developer tools that were launched in December 2024 and match all the criteria you specified (debugging, refactoring, test generation, migration, with mention of Product Hunt or GitHub launches).\n\nHere's what I found during my search:\n\n**General AI Developer Tools Landscape (2024-2025):**\nThe search returned many articles about existing and popular AI developer tools, but no specific tools that launched in December 2024 with all the features you mentioned. The results included:\n\n- **GitHub Copilot** - consistently mentioned as the industry standard\n- **Tabnine** - AI code completion tool\n- **Qodo (formerly CodiumAI)** - mentioned for test generation and debugging\n- **Cursor** - AI-powered code editor\n- **Windsurf** - AI development tool\n- **Zed** - AI-enhanced code editor\n- **Aider** - AI coding assistant\n- **Refraction** - AI code generation and refactoring tool\n\n**Possible Reasons for Limited Results:**\n1. The specific December 2024 timeframe may be too recent for tools to have gained significant online presence\n2. The combination of all those specific features (debugging + refactoring + test generation + migration) may be quite rare in a single tool\n3. Tools may have been launched but not yet widely covered in search results or indexed\n\n**Suggestions:**\n- You might want to try searching for tools that launched in late 2024 with a more flexible date range\n- Consider looking for tools that specialize in 1-2 of the features you mentioned rather than all of them\n- Check Product Hunt's archives directly for December 2024 launches\n- Monitor tech news sources and developer communities for recent AI tool announcements\n\nWould you like me to try a broader search with modified parameters, or are you looking for information about a specific tool you already know about?"

      "Based on my web search, I was unable to find specific AI debugging, refactoring, test generation, or code migration tools that were launched on Product Hunt in December 2024. The search results show:\n\n**What I Found:**\n- Product Hunt has a dedicated category for [AI coding agents](https://www.producthunt.com/categories/ai-coding-agents)\n- There are broader discussions about AI coding tools launched in 2024, including tools like Cursor, Refraction, and others\n- Several comprehensive guides and articles about AI coding tools in 2024/2025\n- General information about AI tools for debugging, refactoring, and test generation\n\n**Possible Reasons for Limited Results:**\n1. **Current Date Context**: The searches may be limited by the current date context relative to December 2024\n2. **Search Indexing**: Recent launches might not be fully indexed in search engines yet\n3. **Search Scope**: The specific combination of Product Hunt + December 2024 + specific AI tool categories may be too narrow\n\n**Recommended Alternative Approaches:**\n- Check Product Hunt directly for recent launches in their [AI coding agents category](https://www.producthunt.com/categories/ai-coding-agents?order=recent_launches)\n- Look at tech news sources and developer communities for December 2024 AI tool launches\n- Monitor AI coding tool company websites and social media for launch announcements\n\nIf you have specific tool names or companies in mind, I'd be happy to search for those directly, or I can help you explore broader AI coding tool trends and launches from 2024."

[assistant message #92]
Now I need to perform the Union stage - merging all the candidate products from all searches. Based on my research, I have not found any AI coding tools that were launched within the last 14 days (December 7-21, 2024). All the tools I found either launched earlier (like Windsurf in November 2024) or were announced in December 2024 but launched later (like Google Jules which launched in August 2025).

[assistant message #103]
Based on my comprehensive research across all 7 question lenses, I was unable to find any AI coding tools that were publicly launched within the last 14 days (December 7-21, 2024) and meet the specified criteria.

## Research Summary

I systematically searched for newly launched AI coding products across 7 different market segments:

1. **Full AI IDEs** - Found Windsurf (launched November 2024), no December launches
2. **AI coding CLIs/terminal agents** - Found Google Jules (announced December 2024, launched August 2025)
3. **Workflow-specific AI tools** - No new launches found in December 2024
4. **Project-long memory AI agents** - No new launches found in December 2024
5. **Open-source self-hostable AI agents** - Found several projects but none launched in December 2024
6. **IDE-integrated AI coding tools** - Found updates to existing tools but no new launches
7. **Complex workflow orchestration agents** - No new launches found in December 2024

## Key Findings

The closest qualifying products I found were:
- **Google Jules** - Announced December 11, 2024, but publicly launched in August 2025
- **Windsurf Editor by Codeium** - Major AI IDE launch, but launched in November 2024

All other AI coding tools I discovered either launched before December 7, 2024, or after December 21, 2024, falling outside the 14-day window requirement.

This suggests that while the AI coding tools market is very active, there may have been a lull in new product launches specifically during December 7-21, 2024, or launches during this period were not widely covered in the sources I accessed.

## Final Result

The `new-product.json` file contains an empty JSON array `[]`, reflecting that no AI coding tools meeting all the specified criteria were launched within the requested timeframe.
