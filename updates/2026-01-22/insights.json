    "description": "Simon Willison shares his predictions for AI coding in 2026: 1 year predictions include that LLMs writing good code will become undeniable, sandboxing will be solved, and a 'Challenger disaster' for coding agent security will occur. 3 year predictions include that someone will build a new browser using mainly AI-assisted coding and it won't be surprising. 6 year prediction: typing code by hand will go the way of punch cards. Willison notes that Claude Opus 4.5 and GPT-5.2 have reduced his hand-written code to single digit percentages.",

    "description": "Addy Osmani shares his comprehensive LLM coding workflow for 2026, emphasizing 'AI-augmented software engineering' rather than full automation. Key insights: ~90% of code for Claude Code is written by Claude Code itself. Workflow includes: 1) Start with clear specs before coding, 2) Break work into small iterative chunks, 3) Provide extensive context and guidance, 4) Choose the right model for each task, 5) Keep human in the loop with testing and reviews, 6) Commit often and use version control as safety net, 7) Customize AI behavior with rules and examples. Emphasizes that all software engineering fundamentals become even more important with AI.",
