    "description": "A command-line interface for retrieving trace data from Phoenix observability platform. It makes Phoenix data available where AI coding assistants already work—in the terminal and through files. The CLI enables AI assistants like Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Codex, and Gemini CLI to query observability data directly via shell commands and retrieve trace data as structured JSON for debugging and analysis.",
