[system]
You are an AI research analyst specialized in AI developer tools:
code agents, AI IDEs, AI coding CLIs, and related devtools.

Your **global goal**:
- Find genuinely new products that have been publicly launched in the **last 14 days**
- AND that clearly target **programming / code / AI dev workflows**
- THEN summarize only the valid ones in a **clean YAML list**.

You MUST treat the questions in the `user:` section as your **research QUESTION list**.
Each QUESTION is a different “angle” on the same market (e.g., full AI IDE, CLI, workflow-focused, etc.).

To organize your reasoning, use this formula:

> Answer = Sort( Filter( Union(Sources) ) )

You must conceptually follow these four stages:

1. **Sources → candidate list (per QUESTION)**
   - For each QUESTION from the `user:` section:
     - Search the web and relevant directories / launch pages.
     - Collect as many **candidate products** as are reasonably relevant.
   - For each candidate, internally track at least:
     - `name` (product name)
     - `url` (official homepage or primary landing page)
     - `description` (1–3 sentences in English summarizing what it does)
     - `sources` (which QUESTION(s) and which site(s) you saw it on)
   - At this stage you are allowed to over-collect; do **not** filter by date yet unless it is trivial.

2. **Union(candidates) → unified candidate set**
   - Merge candidates across all QUESTIONS into a single conceptual set:
     - Deduplicate products that clearly refer to the same thing
       (same URL, or obviously the same product name + branding).
   - After this step you have a unified **candidate pool**:
     - It may still contain old products, or products outside our domain.

3. **Filter(Union) → filtered candidate list**
   - For each product in the unified pool:
     - Investigate its **launch / first public release date** from credible public info
       (official site, launch post, Product Hunt / HN launch, blog, press, etc.).
     - Decide if it satisfies **both**:
       1) Launch date is within the last **14 days** (relative to “today”).
       2) Product is clearly related to **AI coding / code agents / IDE / dev workflows**.
   - If you cannot reasonably verify that the launch is within 14 days,
     **treat it as NOT valid** and exclude it.
   - Internally keep, for each surviving product:
     - `release_date` in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (best reasonable guess)
     - short one-line justification (do not put the justification in final YAML).

4. **Sort(filtered candidates) → final ordered list**
   - Only work with products that passed the filter.
   - Rank them by a simple mental score combining:
     - **recency** (more recent launch date is better),
     - **attention** (strong launch signal: PH upvotes, HN discussion, X/Reddit buzz),
     - **relevance** (how closely it fits “AI coding agent / IDE / devtool”).
   - You do not need to show the numeric score, just use it to order the list.


### Claude Code / todo-style planning requirements

When running inside Claude Code with access to a `todowrite` (or similar TODO-list) tool,
you MUST first externalize this plan as an explicit TODO list **before** doing any research.

Follow these rules:

0. Start with a planning item: add `Consider how to update todos based on products` as the very first TODO.

1. Based on the QUESTION list in the `user:` section, use the `todowrite` tool to create **one TODO item per QUESTION**.  
   - Each item should correspond to “Sources(QUESTION_i)” — i.e., collecting candidates for that QUESTION.

2. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Union** stage:  
   - e.g. “Union(all source results)” to merge candidates from all QUESTION-based source tasks.

3. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Filter** stage:  
   - e.g. “Filter(union) by launch date ≤ 14 days and AI coding relevance”.

4. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Sort** stage and final write-out:  
   - e.g. “Sort(filtered) and write result to result.yaml (or final-products.yaml)”.

A minimal example of the TODO list structure you are expected to build is (showing the alternating “record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” steps):

TODO List
- [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
...
- [ ] Union(sources from 1 to 3)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Write result to new-product.json
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

You may have more than 3 QUESTION-based source items (e.g. 7), but the pattern MUST be the same:
first all `Sources(QUESTION i)` items, then one `Union(...)`, one or more `Filter(...)` based on the number of unique products, one `Sort(...)`,
and finally one “write result” item.

You should use this TODO list as the execution plan and mark items as completed as you progress.

After all `Sources(QUESTION i)` tasks are done, you MUST rewrite the TODO list:
- Replace the generic filter items with one `Filter(<product name>)` per discovered product (the count of Filter items must equal the number of products).
- Keep `Sort(filtered)` and the final write step after those filter items.

Example refreshed TODO after finding 3 products:
TODO List
- [ ] Filter(Product Alpha)
- [ ] Filter(Product Beta)
- [ ] Filter(Product Gamma)
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Write result to result.yaml

**Progress logging pattern (few-shot)**
- After EVERY action item, add an explicit “Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” item (and mark it done once you rewrite and overwrite the file).
- This enforces a rhythm of: do a step → record progress → rewrite TODO → update `new-product.json` → next step.
- Sample pattern the model should mirror:
  - [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Union(all source results)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sort(filtered)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Write result to new-product.json
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

**Final output format (what you actually return):**

- Return a **JSON array** of products, sorted from most to least interesting.
- Each entry MUST have the following fields:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "name": "<product name>",
      "url": "<official homepage>",
      "description": "1–3 sentence summary of what this product does, focused on the developer / AI-coding use case.",
      "release_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "category": "<short label, e.g. \"AI IDE\", \"AI coding CLI\", \"code agent\", \"workflow agent\">",
      "sources": ["Product Hunt", "Show HN", "Reddit", "X"],
      "community_quotes": [
        "<short quote from community describing what people like or notice>",
        "<up to 5 quotes total, can be paraphrased but must reflect real feedback>"
      ]
    }
  ]
```

* Only include products that:

  * You have **good evidence** were launched in the last 14 days, and
  * Clearly belong to the **AI coding / developer tools** space.

* If you cannot find any products that satisfy the 14-day constraint,
  return an empty JSON array: `[]`.

Be concise, factual, and avoid marketing fluff. Do **not** include your reasoning text
in the final answer—only the JSON.

**File output + incremental updates requirement**
- Maintain a file named `new-product` in the current working directory.
- After every step (including each “Record progress, rewrite todo”), write the current JSON array to `new-product` (overwrite). Early steps may be partial/rough; later steps should be refined.
- The JSON must always be valid and reflect the best current view (start with `[]` if nothing yet).
- After the final step, ensure `new-product` holds the final sorted array.

## Working Directory Context

Your current working directory is: `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2026-01-22`

All file operations should be relative to this directory.

Below is your QUESTION list. For each QUESTION, treat it as a separate “research lens”
to discover newly launched AI coding products (global constraint: last 14 days).

1. QUESTION 1
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that position themselves as a “full AI IDE” (similar to Windsurf or Cursor), not just a small autocomplete plugin.

2. QUESTION 2
   List newly launched AI coding CLIs or terminal-based agents from the last 14 days that behave like Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, or Claude Code CLI (repo-aware, can run commands, can manage tasks).

3. QUESTION 5
   List newly launched AI tools from the last 14 days that focus on one specific developer workflow (for example debugging, refactoring, test generation, or migration) instead of being a general-purpose coding assistant.

4. QUESTION 7
   List newly launched AI code agents from the last 14 days that advertise “project-long memory” or “workspace memory” across multiple sessions (not just single-chat context).

5. QUESTION 11
   List newly launched open-source AI coding agents from the last 14 days that can be self-hosted or run locally by developers.

6. QUESTION 14
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that integrate directly into existing IDEs (such as VS Code, JetBrains, or Neovim) rather than being a standalone IDE.

7. QUESTION 16
   List newly launched AI agents from the last 14 days that help developers run or orchestrate complex workflows across tools (for example CI/CD, deployment, observability, or incident response), rather than only editing code.

[assistant message #2]
I'll help you research newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days. Let me start by creating a comprehensive TODO list and then systematically work through each question.

For the strict 14-day window ending today, there don't appear to be any completely **new** AI IDE launches, but rather updates to existing platforms and 2026 trend articles discussing the current state of AI coding tools.\n\nWould you like me to search for more specific information about any of these tools or explore a different angle?\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

For the strict 14-day window ending today, there don't appear to be any completely **new** AI IDE launches, but rather updates to existing platforms and 2026 trend articles discussing the current state of AI coding tools.\n\nWould you like me to search for more specific information about any of these tools or explore a different angle?"

Key features include:\n\n- Built on Google's new **Gemini 3 Pro** model\n- An **agent-first IDE** (Integrated Development Environment)\n- Enables developers to build and ship software faster using AI-powered coding capabilities\n- Part of Google's push into AI-first development tools\n\n## January 2026 Events\n\n- **January 16, 2026**: Google Developer Group (GDG) Singapore hosted an event about Google Antigravity (\"Build faster, ship smarter\")\n- Multiple independent reviews and hands-on articles were published in early January 2026 by developers who had tried the platform\n\nSo while Antigravity was **announced in November 2025** and became available in public preview shortly after, **January 2026** was indeed an important month when the developer community started actively using and reviewing the platform.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

      "Based on my web search results, here's what I found about Google Antigravity's launch timeline:\n\n## Google Antigravity - Key Dates\n\n**Announcement:** November 18, 2025\n- Google Antigravity was announced alongside the release of **Gemini 3** on November 18, 2025\n- This was reported by multiple sources including Wikipedia, Google's official blog, Fortune, and various tech publications\n\n**Availability:** Public Preview (November 2025 - January 2026)\n- According to Google's Developer Blog, Antigravity became available in **public preview** with no cost for individuals\n- Various reviews and first impressions were published in **January 2026** (e.g., January 4, January 21)\n\n## What is Google Antigravity?\n\nGoogle Antigravity is a **new agentic development platform** designed to help developers delegate complex coding tasks to autonomous AI agents. Key features include:\n\n- Built on Google's new **Gemini 3 Pro** model\n- An **agent-first IDE** (Integrated Development Environment)\n- Enables developers to build and ship software faster using AI-powered coding capabilities\n- Part of Google's push into AI-first development tools\n\n## January 2026 Events\n\n- **January 16, 2026**: Google Developer Group (GDG) Singapore hosted an event about Google Antigravity (\"Build faster, ship smarter\")\n- Multiple independent reviews and hands-on articles were published in early January 2026 by developers who had tried the platform\n\nSo while Antigravity was **announced in November 2025** and became available in public preview shortly after, **January 2026** was indeed an important month when the developer community started actively using and reviewing the platform."

Here are the key findings:\n\n## New Releases and Updates in January 2026\n\n### 1. **Phoenix CLI - January 17, 2026**\nThe Phoenix CLI was released with terminal access for AI coding agent debugging. It makes Phoenix data available directly in the terminal where AI assistants already work.\n\n### 2. **OpenCode AI - January 20, 2026**\nA comprehensive guide was published about OpenCode AI, describing it as \"revolutionizing development in 2026.\" It's an open-source terminal-native AI coding agent.\n\n### 3. **Recent CLI Coding Agent Roundups**\nMultiple recent articles (within the past week) compare the top CLI-based AI coding agents for 2026, including:\n\n### 4. **New Tools and Projects**\n- **OpenCode**: A terminal-native AI coding agent designed to work directly in the terminal environment rather than in sidebars\n- **Multi-agent terminal**: A GitHub project called \"architect\" that allows running multiple AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, or Gemini) in parallel\n\n### Popular AI Terminal Coding Agents in 2026:\n- **Claude Code**\n- **Aider** (respects Git workflows, works offline)\n- **OpenCode** (open-source, terminal-native)\n- **Gemini CLI** (connects Google's AI models to terminal)\n- **Phoenix CLI** (for AI debugging)\n\nThe trend appears to be toward terminal-native AI coding assistants that integrate directly into developers' command-line workflows rather than requiring separate IDE integrations."

Here's what I did find:\n\n## About Metoro\n\n**Metoro** (metoro.io) is a real company that provides:\n\n- **AI-powered Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) for Kubernetes**\n- An AI agent that helps debug production systems\n- Autonomous deployment verification, issue detection, root cause analysis, and remediation\n- Integration with existing observability stacks like DataDog and Grafana\n\n## Company Background\n\n- **Y Combinator Alumni**: Metoro participated in Y Combinator (appears to be S23 batch based on references from 2023)\n- **Founded**: The company has been operational since at least 2023\n- **Size**: 2-10 employees according to LinkedIn\n- **Headquarters**: San Francisco, California\n- **Current Status**: Already launched and operational with a live product\n\n## Key Points\n\n1. **Metoro is NOT a new company launching in January 2026** - it's already an established, operating company\n2. The search results show Metoro has been active since at least 2023\n3. There's no evidence of any upcoming \"launch\" in January 2026\n\nIt's possible there may be some confusion with:\n- **Meta's AI Supercluster \"Prometheus\"** which is scheduled to launch in 2026 (but this is Meta/Facebook, not Metoro)\n- Another AI company with a similar name\n\nIf you're looking for information about a specific product launch or feature release from Metoro in January 2026, I couldn't find any announcements about that. Could you clarify what specific information you're seeking about Metoro?\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

      "Based on my web search, I couldn't find any specific information about \"Metoro AI\" having a launch date in January 2026. Here's what I did find:\n\n## About Metoro\n\n**Metoro** (metoro.io) is a real company that provides:\n\n- **AI-powered Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) for Kubernetes**\n- An AI agent that helps debug production systems\n- Autonomous deployment verification, issue detection, root cause analysis, and remediation\n- Integration with existing observability stacks like DataDog and Grafana\n\n## Company Background\n\n- **Y Combinator Alumni**: Metoro participated in Y Combinator (appears to be S23 batch based on references from 2023)\n- **Founded**: The company has been operational since at least 2023\n- **Size**: 2-10 employees according to LinkedIn\n- **Headquarters**: San Francisco, California\n- **Current Status**: Already launched and operational with a live product\n\n## Key Points\n\n1. **Metoro is NOT a new company launching in January 2026** - it's already an established, operating company\n2. The search results show Metoro has been active since at least 2023\n3. There's no evidence of any upcoming \"launch\" in January 2026\n\nIt's possible there may be some confusion with:\n- **Meta's AI Supercluster \"Prometheus\"** which is scheduled to launch in 2026 (but this is Meta/Facebook, not Metoro)\n- Another AI company with a similar name\n\nIf you're looking for information about a specific product launch or feature release from Metoro in January 2026, I couldn't find any announcements about that. Could you clarify what specific information you're seeking about Metoro?"

However, here's what I found related to AI coding agents:\n\n## Recent AI Coding Agent Launches:\n\n### JetBrains Junie (January 23, 2025)\n- **JetBrains launched Junie**, a new AI coding agent integrated into their IDEs\n- Designed to handle routine development tasks and create new applications\n- Launch date: January 23, 2025\n\n### Other Notable AI Coding Agents (2025):\n1. **ByteDance's coding agent** (November 2025) - Very affordable at $1.30/month\n2. **Google's Jules** (Public beta, May 2025) - Autonomous coding agent\n3. **OpenAI's Codex** (May 2025) - Software engineering agent\n4. **xAI's agentic coding model** (August 2025) - Elon Musk's entry into the coding agent space\n\n## Important Note:\nThe search results show coding agent launches from **2025**, not 2026. Since the current date appears to be late 2025 (based on the most recent search results being from November 2025), a January 2026 launch would be in the future.\n\n**Possible scenarios:**\n- The AI coding agent you're looking for may have a different name or feature description\n- It might be part of a product announcement or roadmap rather than a full launch\n- The terminology might be different (e.g., \"codebase awareness,\" \"context retention,\" etc.)\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Search for more specific terms related to project/workspace memory features in coding agents?\n2. Search for announcements or roadmaps for January 2026 releases?\n3. Look for coding agents with context-aware or codebase-aware features?\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

However, here's what I found related to AI coding agents:\n\n## Recent AI Coding Agent Launches:\n\n### JetBrains Junie (January 23, 2025)\n- **JetBrains launched Junie**, a new AI coding agent integrated into their IDEs\n- Designed to handle routine development tasks and create new applications\n- Launch date: January 23, 2025\n\n### Other Notable AI Coding Agents (2025):\n1. **ByteDance's coding agent** (November 2025) - Very affordable at $1.30/month\n2. **Google's Jules** (Public beta, May 2025) - Autonomous coding agent\n3. **OpenAI's Codex** (May 2025) - Software engineering agent\n4. **xAI's agentic coding model** (August 2025) - Elon Musk's entry into the coding agent space\n\n## Important Note:\nThe search results show coding agent launches from **2025**, not 2026. Since the current date appears to be late 2025 (based on the most recent search results being from November 2025), a January 2026 launch would be in the future.\n\n**Possible scenarios:**\n- The AI coding agent you're looking for may have a different name or feature description\n- It might be part of a product announcement or roadmap rather than a full launch\n- The terminology might be different (e.g., \"codebase awareness,\" \"context retention,\" etc.)\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Search for more specific terms related to project/workspace memory features in coding agents?\n2. Search for announcements or roadmaps for January 2026 releases?\n3. Look for coding agents with context-aware or codebase-aware features?"

[assistant message #113]
After extensive research across all seven questions, I found that **Phoenix CLI** by Arize is the only product that definitively meets the strict 14-day launch window criteria:

- **Launch date**: January 17, 2026 (5 days ago from the current date of January 22, 2026)
- **Category**: AI coding CLI / debugging tool
- **Relevance**: Clearly targets AI coding workflows by providing terminal access to observability data for AI coding assistants

Other tools I investigated either:
- Launched before the 14-day window (Google Antigravity: Nov 2025, Visual Studio 2026: Dec 2025, OpenCode: July 2025)
- Could not be definitively verified to have launched within the last 14 days (ContextStream, Pythagora, Metoro)
- Were comparison/roundup articles rather than new product launches

Let me finalize the result:
