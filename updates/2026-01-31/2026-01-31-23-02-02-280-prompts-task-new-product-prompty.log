[system]
You are an AI research analyst specialized in AI developer tools:
code agents, AI IDEs, AI coding CLIs, and related devtools.

Your **global goal**:
- Find genuinely new products that have been publicly launched in the **last 14 days**
- AND that clearly target **programming / code / AI dev workflows**
- THEN summarize only the valid ones in a **clean YAML list**.

You MUST treat the questions in the `user:` section as your **research QUESTION list**.
Each QUESTION is a different “angle” on the same market (e.g., full AI IDE, CLI, workflow-focused, etc.).

To organize your reasoning, use this formula:

> Answer = Sort( Filter( Union(Sources) ) )

You must conceptually follow these four stages:

1. **Sources → candidate list (per QUESTION)**
   - For each QUESTION from the `user:` section:
     - Search the web and relevant directories / launch pages.
     - Collect as many **candidate products** as are reasonably relevant.
   - For each candidate, internally track at least:
     - `name` (product name)
     - `url` (official homepage or primary landing page)
     - `description` (1–3 sentences in English summarizing what it does)
     - `sources` (which QUESTION(s) and which site(s) you saw it on)
   - At this stage you are allowed to over-collect; do **not** filter by date yet unless it is trivial.

2. **Union(candidates) → unified candidate set**
   - Merge candidates across all QUESTIONS into a single conceptual set:
     - Deduplicate products that clearly refer to the same thing
       (same URL, or obviously the same product name + branding).
   - After this step you have a unified **candidate pool**:
     - It may still contain old products, or products outside our domain.

3. **Filter(Union) → filtered candidate list**
   - For each product in the unified pool:
     - Investigate its **launch / first public release date** from credible public info
       (official site, launch post, Product Hunt / HN launch, blog, press, etc.).
     - Decide if it satisfies **both**:
       1) Launch date is within the last **14 days** (relative to “today”).
       2) Product is clearly related to **AI coding / code agents / IDE / dev workflows**.
   - If you cannot reasonably verify that the launch is within 14 days,
     **treat it as NOT valid** and exclude it.
   - Internally keep, for each surviving product:
     - `release_date` in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (best reasonable guess)
     - short one-line justification (do not put the justification in final YAML).

4. **Sort(filtered candidates) → final ordered list**
   - Only work with products that passed the filter.
   - Rank them by a simple mental score combining:
     - **recency** (more recent launch date is better),
     - **attention** (strong launch signal: PH upvotes, HN discussion, X/Reddit buzz),
     - **relevance** (how closely it fits “AI coding agent / IDE / devtool”).
   - You do not need to show the numeric score, just use it to order the list.


### Claude Code / todo-style planning requirements

When running inside Claude Code with access to a `todowrite` (or similar TODO-list) tool,
you MUST first externalize this plan as an explicit TODO list **before** doing any research.

Follow these rules:

0. Start with a planning item: add `Consider how to update todos based on products` as the very first TODO.

1. Based on the QUESTION list in the `user:` section, use the `todowrite` tool to create **one TODO item per QUESTION**.  
   - Each item should correspond to “Sources(QUESTION_i)” — i.e., collecting candidates for that QUESTION.

2. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Union** stage:  
   - e.g. “Union(all source results)” to merge candidates from all QUESTION-based source tasks.

3. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Filter** stage:  
   - e.g. “Filter(union) by launch date ≤ 14 days and AI coding relevance”.

4. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Sort** stage and final write-out:  
   - e.g. “Sort(filtered) and write result to result.yaml (or final-products.yaml)”.

A minimal example of the TODO list structure you are expected to build is (showing the alternating “record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” steps):

TODO List
- [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
...
- [ ] Union(sources from 1 to 3)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Write result to new-product.json
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

You may have more than 3 QUESTION-based source items (e.g. 7), but the pattern MUST be the same:
first all `Sources(QUESTION i)` items, then one `Union(...)`, one or more `Filter(...)` based on the number of unique products, one `Sort(...)`,
and finally one “write result” item.

You should use this TODO list as the execution plan and mark items as completed as you progress.

After all `Sources(QUESTION i)` tasks are done, you MUST rewrite the TODO list:
- Replace the generic filter items with one `Filter(<product name>)` per discovered product (the count of Filter items must equal the number of products).
- Keep `Sort(filtered)` and the final write step after those filter items.

Example refreshed TODO after finding 3 products:
TODO List
- [ ] Filter(Product Alpha)
- [ ] Filter(Product Beta)
- [ ] Filter(Product Gamma)
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Write result to result.yaml

**Progress logging pattern (few-shot)**
- After EVERY action item, add an explicit “Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” item (and mark it done once you rewrite and overwrite the file).
- This enforces a rhythm of: do a step → record progress → rewrite TODO → update `new-product.json` → next step.
- Sample pattern the model should mirror:
  - [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Union(all source results)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sort(filtered)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Write result to new-product.json
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

**Final output format (what you actually return):**

- Return a **JSON array** of products, sorted from most to least interesting.
- Each entry MUST have the following fields:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "name": "<product name>",
      "url": "<official homepage>",
      "description": "1–3 sentence summary of what this product does, focused on the developer / AI-coding use case.",
      "release_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "category": "<short label, e.g. \"AI IDE\", \"AI coding CLI\", \"code agent\", \"workflow agent\">",
      "sources": ["Product Hunt", "Show HN", "Reddit", "X"],
      "community_quotes": [
        "<short quote from community describing what people like or notice>",
        "<up to 5 quotes total, can be paraphrased but must reflect real feedback>"
      ]
    }
  ]
```

* Only include products that:

  * You have **good evidence** were launched in the last 14 days, and
  * Clearly belong to the **AI coding / developer tools** space.

* If you cannot find any products that satisfy the 14-day constraint,
  return an empty JSON array: `[]`.

Be concise, factual, and avoid marketing fluff. Do **not** include your reasoning text
in the final answer—only the JSON.

**File output + incremental updates requirement**
- Maintain a file named `new-product` in the current working directory.
- After every step (including each “Record progress, rewrite todo”), write the current JSON array to `new-product` (overwrite). Early steps may be partial/rough; later steps should be refined.
- The JSON must always be valid and reflect the best current view (start with `[]` if nothing yet).
- After the final step, ensure `new-product` holds the final sorted array.

## Working Directory Context

Your current working directory is: `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2026-01-31`

All file operations should be relative to this directory.

Below is your QUESTION list. For each QUESTION, treat it as a separate “research lens”
to discover newly launched AI coding products (global constraint: last 14 days).

1. QUESTION 1
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that position themselves as a “full AI IDE” (similar to Windsurf or Cursor), not just a small autocomplete plugin.

2. QUESTION 2
   List newly launched AI coding CLIs or terminal-based agents from the last 14 days that behave like Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, or Claude Code CLI (repo-aware, can run commands, can manage tasks).

3. QUESTION 5
   List newly launched AI tools from the last 14 days that focus on one specific developer workflow (for example debugging, refactoring, test generation, or migration) instead of being a general-purpose coding assistant.

4. QUESTION 7
   List newly launched AI code agents from the last 14 days that advertise “project-long memory” or “workspace memory” across multiple sessions (not just single-chat context).

5. QUESTION 11
   List newly launched open-source AI coding agents from the last 14 days that can be self-hosted or run locally by developers.

6. QUESTION 14
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that integrate directly into existing IDEs (such as VS Code, JetBrains, or Neovim) rather than being a standalone IDE.

7. QUESTION 16
   List newly launched AI agents from the last 14 days that help developers run or orchestrate complex workflows across tools (for example CI/CD, deployment, observability, or incident response), rather than only editing code.

[assistant message #2]
I'll help you research newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days. Let me start by creating a TODO list to track this research systematically.

I notice there's an issue with the search results - they appear to be showing dates in the future (January 2026), but the current working directory shows "2026-01-31" which means we are actually in January 2026. Let me focus on finding actual product launches from the last 14 days (January 17-31, 2026). Let me try a different approach:

Launched previously (a post from X/Twitter shows it was already live on Product Hunt \"1 year ago\")\n  - Described as \"an adaptive AI IDE that transforms how you work, collaborating with you to run faster\"\n  - Has **23 reviews** with a **4.7 rating**\n  - Official website: https://www.trae.ai/\n  - There's also mention of TRAE having a SOLO mode in China and an international version\n\n### **January 2026 AI IDE/Code Editor Activity**\nThe search did show significant activity in the AI code editor/IDE space in January 2026, including:\n- Numerous articles about best AI code editors of 2026\n- Discussions about AI coding agents and tools\n- Other AI-related Product Hunt launches (like Fimo with #2 ranking and 262 upvotes)\n\n### **Conclusion**\nNeither RightNow AI nor Trae AI appear to have launched specifically in January 2026 on Product Hunt based on the search results. Trae AI has been on Product Hunt for some time with good reviews, while RightNow AI exists but shows no evidence of a January 2026 Product Hunt launch.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

Here's what I found:\n\n### Key Search Results\n\n1. **General AI Coding Tools Landscape (January 2026)**\n   - Multiple sources published comprehensive guides and comparisons of AI coding tools in January 2026\n   - Articles from Augment Code, Medium, and various tech blogs covering the \"best AI coding assistants\" and \"AI coding agents\" for 2026\n\n2. **Specific AI Tool Coverage**\n   - **Claude Code**: Mentioned as bringing \"vibe coding to everyone\" - Anthropic's developer assistant tool\n   - **GitHub Copilot**: Noted as the most widely adopted AI coding tool\n   - **AI Code Review Tools**: Qodo published a guide on AI code review tools (Dec 2025/Jan 2026 timeframe)\n\n3. **Test Generation and Debugging**\n   - BrowserStack published content on \"Generating End-to-End Tests with AI and Playwright MCP\" (January 16, 2026)\n   - Articles covering AI test generation best practices and tools for QA teams\n   - Addy Osmani published \"Code Review in the Age of AI\" (January 5, 2026)\n\n4. **Industry Developments**\n   - Forbes reported on Anthropic's coding agent strategy (January 16, 2026)\n   - SD Times published \"January 2026: AI updates from the past month\"\n   - Multiple sources discussing AI coding workflows and agent debugging platforms\n\n### Limitation\nI did not find a **specific, singular tool launch announcement** in January 2026 that combines all three capabilities (test generation, code review, and debugging) in a single release. The search results show:\n\n- General coverage of existing tools\n- Roundup articles about the best AI tools for 2026\n- Individual updates to specific tools (like Playwright AI test generation)\n- Industry analysis rather than product launch announcements\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Search for more specific tool names or companies?\n2. Look into any of the mentioned tools in more detail?\n3. Search for announcements from specific vendors (like Anthropic, Microsoft, GitHub, etc.)?\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

      "## Web Search Results Summary\n\nI searched for information about AI test generation, code review, and debugging tool launches in January 2026. Here's what I found:\n\n### Key Search Results\n\n1. **General AI Coding Tools Landscape (January 2026)**\n   - Multiple sources published comprehensive guides and comparisons of AI coding tools in January 2026\n   - Articles from Augment Code, Medium, and various tech blogs covering the \"best AI coding assistants\" and \"AI coding agents\" for 2026\n\n2. **Specific AI Tool Coverage**\n   - **Claude Code**: Mentioned as bringing \"vibe coding to everyone\" - Anthropic's developer assistant tool\n   - **GitHub Copilot**: Noted as the most widely adopted AI coding tool\n   - **AI Code Review Tools**: Qodo published a guide on AI code review tools (Dec 2025/Jan 2026 timeframe)\n\n3. **Test Generation and Debugging**\n   - BrowserStack published content on \"Generating End-to-End Tests with AI and Playwright MCP\" (January 16, 2026)\n   - Articles covering AI test generation best practices and tools for QA teams\n   - Addy Osmani published \"Code Review in the Age of AI\" (January 5, 2026)\n\n4. **Industry Developments**\n   - Forbes reported on Anthropic's coding agent strategy (January 16, 2026)\n   - SD Times published \"January 2026: AI updates from the past month\"\n   - Multiple sources discussing AI coding workflows and agent debugging platforms\n\n### Limitation\nI did not find a **specific, singular tool launch announcement** in January 2026 that combines all three capabilities (test generation, code review, and debugging) in a single release. The search results show:\n\n- General coverage of existing tools\n- Roundup articles about the best AI tools for 2026\n- Individual updates to specific tools (like Playwright AI test generation)\n- Industry analysis rather than product launch announcements\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Search for more specific tool names or companies?\n2. Look into any of the mentioned tools in more detail?\n3. Search for announcements from specific vendors (like Anthropic, Microsoft, GitHub, etc.)?"

Now let me finalize the sorted list. Based on recency, attention/significance, and relevance to AI coding, here's my ranking:

1. **ACP Agent Registry** (Jan 28) - Most significant, major industry collaboration
2. **Kilo Code Reviewer** (Jan 27) - Product Hunt Launch of the Day winner
3. **SERA** (Jan 27) - Major open-source release from Ai2, strong benchmark performance
4. **Kimi K2.5** (Jan 27) - Significant open-source agent from China
5. **Mastra 1.0** (Jan 22) - Strong Product Hunt performance, YC-backed
6. **OpenCode AI** (Jan 20) - Explosive growth with 70K+ stars

The current ordering is already by recency, which is appropriate. Let me mark the sorting complete and write the final result:
