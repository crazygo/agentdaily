    "description": "Antirez (Salvatore Sanfilippo, creator of Redis) shares comprehensive reflections on AI in 2025, noting that programmer resistance to AI-assisted programming has lowered considerably as LLMs improved. He discusses how RLVR (Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards) is changing LLM capabilities, observes that chain of thought is now fundamental to LLM output, and reflects on whether AGI is achievable with current architectures. The post sparked extensive Hacker News discussion about LLM utility, limitations, and future implications.",

    "description": "Andrej Karpathy's comprehensive review of LLM developments in 2025, highlighting six major paradigm shifts: 1) Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) emerging as a new major training stage, 2) Understanding LLMs as 'ghosts' rather than 'animals' with jagged intelligence profiles, 3) Cursor revealing a new layer of LLM applications that orchestrate multiple model calls, 4) Claude Code demonstrating the first convincing LLM agent that runs locally, 5) Vibe coding making programming accessible to everyone via natural language, and 6) Google Gemini Nano pointing toward LLM GUIs. Karpathy emphasizes we haven't unlocked 10% of LLM potential yet.",

    "title": "My LLM Coding Workflow Going Into 2026",
    "description": "Addy Osmani shares his comprehensive AI-assisted engineering workflow, emphasizing that ~90% of Claude Code's code is now written by Claude Code itself. Key principles include: 1) Start with clear specs before coding, 2) Break work into small iterative chunks, 3) Provide extensive context and guidance, 4) Choose the right model for each task, 5) Leverage AI across the software development lifecycle, 6) Keep human in the loop with verification and testing, 7) Commit often and use version control as safety net, 8) Customize AI behavior with rules and examples, 9) Embrace testing and automation, 10) Continuously learn and adapt. Osmani advocates for 'AI-augmented software engineering' rather than fully automated development.",

    "description": "OpenAI releases GPT-5.2-Codex, described as 'the most advanced agentic coding model for professional software engineering and defensive cybersecurity.' Key features include improvements on long-horizon work through context compaction, stronger performance on large code changes like refactors and migrations, improved performance in Windows environments, and significantly stronger cybersecurity capabilities. OpenAI notes the model's stronger cyber capabilities also raise new dual-use risks requiring careful deployment. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on SWE-Bench Pro and Terminal-Bench 2.0 benchmarks.",

    "description": "Simon Willison covers Google's release of Gemini 3 Flash, a faster and less expensive model that costs 1/4 of Gemini 3 Pro for tokens under 200k and 1/8 for tokens over 200k. The model supports thinking levels (minimal, low, medium, high), uses 30% fewer tokens on average than 2.5 Pro, and surpasses the previous generation's top model across many benchmarks. Willison demonstrates the model's capabilities by using it to build an image gallery Web Component, with total cost for five prompts being only 4.8 cents.",
