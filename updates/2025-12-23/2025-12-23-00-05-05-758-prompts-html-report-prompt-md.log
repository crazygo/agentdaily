# HTML Report Generation Prompt

You are an expert web developer and data visualization specialist. Your task is to transform research data from Markdown format into a beautifully styled, multi-column HTML page inspired by Hacker News' design principles.

## Input Data Analysis

You will receive research data in Markdown format containing:
- New products and tools in the agentic coding space
- Updates to existing products (whitelist)
- Technical insights and opinions
- Product information with descriptions, links, and metadata

## HTML Report Requirements

### Design Principles (Hacker News-inspired)
1. **Clean, minimal design** with excellent readability
2. **Multi-column layout** for efficient information scanning
3. **Subtle colors** (primarily grayscale with orange accent color)
4. **Monospace fonts** for code elements, sans-serif for content
5. **High contrast** for easy reading
6. **Responsive design** that works on different screen sizes

### Layout Structure
- **Header section** with title and date
- **Main content area** with 3-column grid layout
- **Left column**: New Products (40% width)
- **Middle column**: Whitelist Updates (35% width)
- **Right column**: Technical Insights (25% width)
- **Footer** with simple navigation

### Styling Guidelines
- **Color Scheme**:
  - Background: #f6f6ef
  - Primary text: #000000
  - Secondary text: #828282
  - Accent color: #ff6600 (for links and highlights)
  - Border colors: #d4d4d4
- **Typography**:
  - Headings: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif
  - Body text: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif
  - Code: Monaco, Consolas, monospace
- **Spacing**: Compact but readable, similar to Hacker News

### Content Organization
1. **New Products Section**
   - Product name as clickable link
   - One-sentence description
   - Source/platform indicator
   - Tags or categories

2. **Whitelist Updates Section**
   - Product name and version
   - Update summary (2-3 sentences max)
   - Release date if available
   - Link to full release notes

3. **Technical Insights Section**
   - Insight title or summary
   - Author/source attribution
   - Key takeaway points
   - Link to full content

## Output Format

**IMPORTANT**: You MUST write the generated HTML to a file named `index.html` in the current working directory.

Use the Write tool to create the file with this exact filename: `index.html`

Requirements for the HTML:

1. **Embedded CSS** in `<style>` tag
2. **Semantic HTML structure** with proper headings
3. **Responsive CSS Grid or Flexbox layout**
4. **Interactive elements** (hover effects, clickable links)
5. **Print-friendly styles** for archiving
6. **Complete, valid HTML5 document** ready to be opened in a browser

The file structure should be:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <!-- All HTML content here -->
</head>
<body>
    <!-- All content here -->
</body>
</html>
```

## Technical Requirements

1. **Valid HTML5** markup
2. **Cross-browser compatibility** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
3. **Mobile responsive** design
4. **Fast loading** (minimal external dependencies)
5. **Accessibility** features (alt text, proper heading hierarchy)

## Content Processing Rules

1. **Parse the Markdown input** and extract structured data
2. **Categorize content** into the three main sections
3. **Truncate long descriptions** to maintain clean layout
4. **Preserve all links** and make them functional
5. **Format dates consistently** (YYYY-MM-DD format)
6. **Handle missing data gracefully** with fallback content

## Quality Standards

- **Information density**: Maximize content per screen area while maintaining readability
- **Visual hierarchy**: Clear distinction between different content types
- **User experience**: Easy scanning and quick access to key information
- **Professional appearance**: Suitable for business/technical audience
- **Performance**: Fast rendering and smooth scrolling

## Example Structure

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Agentic Coding Research Report - {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE}</title>
    <style>
        /* Hacker News-inspired CSS styling */
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <!-- Header content -->
    </header>

    <main class="three-column-layout">
        <section class="new-products">
            <!-- New products content -->
        </section>

        <section class="whitelist-updates">
            <!-- Whitelist updates content -->
        </section>

        <section class="technical-insights">
            <!-- Technical insights content -->
        </section>
    </main>

    <footer>
        <!-- Footer content -->
    </footer>
</body>
</html>
```

Please analyze the provided Markdown research data and transform it into a professional, Hacker News-style HTML report following all the specifications above.

[assistant message #17]
Perfect! I've created a beautiful Hacker News-inspired HTML report at `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2025-12-23/index.html`.

## What I Created

The HTML report includes:

### Design Features
- **Hacker News-inspired aesthetic** with the characteristic orange (#ff6600) accent color
- **Clean, minimal design** with #f6f6ef background matching HN's style
- **Three-column responsive layout** (40% / 35% / 25% split)
- **Monospace and sans-serif fonts** for that technical feel
- **High contrast** for excellent readability

### Content Organization

**Left Column - New Products (40%)**
- Cursor Visual Editor - AI-powered visual design tool
- Morph - Fast code editing with subagents (10,500+ tokens/sec)

**Middle Column - Whitelist Updates (35%)**
- Cursor 2.2 with Debug Mode and Visual Editor
- Copilot Memory feature for persistent context
- Copilot Code Review for Enterprise Cloud
- Windsurf 1.12.28 with enhanced Codemaps
- Gemini CLI 0.208.0 with auto session management
- OpenAI Codex CLI with GPT-5.2-Codex
- Continue with enhanced file access

**Right Column - Technical Insights (25%)**
- Antirez's reflections on AI in 2025
- Andrej Karpathy's 2025 LLM Year in Review
- Addy Osmani's AI-augmented engineering workflow
- OpenAI GPT-5.2-Codex announcement
- Simon Willison on Gemini 3 Flash

### Interactive Elements
- Hover effects on all links
- Color-coded update types (release/feature)
- Tags for quick topic scanning
- Community quotes for social proof
- Print-friendly styles for archiving
- Fully responsive design for mobile devices

The file is ready to be opened in any web browser and provides a comprehensive, visually appealing overview of the agentic coding landscape as of December 23, 2025!
