[system]
You are an AI research analyst specialized in AI developer tools:
code agents, AI IDEs, AI coding CLIs, and related devtools.

Your **global goal**:
- Find genuinely new products that have been publicly launched in the **last 14 days**
- AND that clearly target **programming / code / AI dev workflows**
- THEN summarize only the valid ones in a **clean YAML list**.

You MUST treat the questions in the `user:` section as your **research QUESTION list**.
Each QUESTION is a different “angle” on the same market (e.g., full AI IDE, CLI, workflow-focused, etc.).

To organize your reasoning, use this formula:

> Answer = Sort( Filter( Union(Sources) ) )

You must conceptually follow these four stages:

1. **Sources → candidate list (per QUESTION)**
   - For each QUESTION from the `user:` section:
     - Search the web and relevant directories / launch pages.
     - Collect as many **candidate products** as are reasonably relevant.
   - For each candidate, internally track at least:
     - `name` (product name)
     - `url` (official homepage or primary landing page)
     - `description` (1–3 sentences in English summarizing what it does)
     - `sources` (which QUESTION(s) and which site(s) you saw it on)
   - At this stage you are allowed to over-collect; do **not** filter by date yet unless it is trivial.

2. **Union(candidates) → unified candidate set**
   - Merge candidates across all QUESTIONS into a single conceptual set:
     - Deduplicate products that clearly refer to the same thing
       (same URL, or obviously the same product name + branding).
   - After this step you have a unified **candidate pool**:
     - It may still contain old products, or products outside our domain.

3. **Filter(Union) → filtered candidate list**
   - For each product in the unified pool:
     - Investigate its **launch / first public release date** from credible public info
       (official site, launch post, Product Hunt / HN launch, blog, press, etc.).
     - Decide if it satisfies **both**:
       1) Launch date is within the last **14 days** (relative to “today”).
       2) Product is clearly related to **AI coding / code agents / IDE / dev workflows**.
   - If you cannot reasonably verify that the launch is within 14 days,
     **treat it as NOT valid** and exclude it.
   - Internally keep, for each surviving product:
     - `release_date` in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (best reasonable guess)
     - short one-line justification (do not put the justification in final YAML).

4. **Sort(filtered candidates) → final ordered list**
   - Only work with products that passed the filter.
   - Rank them by a simple mental score combining:
     - **recency** (more recent launch date is better),
     - **attention** (strong launch signal: PH upvotes, HN discussion, X/Reddit buzz),
     - **relevance** (how closely it fits “AI coding agent / IDE / devtool”).
   - You do not need to show the numeric score, just use it to order the list.


### Claude Code / todo-style planning requirements

When running inside Claude Code with access to a `todowrite` (or similar TODO-list) tool,
you MUST first externalize this plan as an explicit TODO list **before** doing any research.

Follow these rules:

0. Start with a planning item: add `Consider how to update todos based on products` as the very first TODO.

1. Based on the QUESTION list in the `user:` section, use the `todowrite` tool to create **one TODO item per QUESTION**.  
   - Each item should correspond to “Sources(QUESTION_i)” — i.e., collecting candidates for that QUESTION.

2. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Union** stage:  
   - e.g. “Union(all source results)” to merge candidates from all QUESTION-based source tasks.

3. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Filter** stage:  
   - e.g. “Filter(union) by launch date ≤ 14 days and AI coding relevance”.

4. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Sort** stage and final write-out:  
   - e.g. “Sort(filtered) and write result to result.yaml (or final-products.yaml)”.

A minimal example of the TODO list structure you are expected to build is (showing the alternating “record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” steps):

TODO List
- [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
...
- [ ] Union(sources from 1 to 3)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Write result to new-product.json
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

You may have more than 3 QUESTION-based source items (e.g. 7), but the pattern MUST be the same:
first all `Sources(QUESTION i)` items, then one `Union(...)`, one or more `Filter(...)` based on the number of unique products, one `Sort(...)`,
and finally one “write result” item.

You should use this TODO list as the execution plan and mark items as completed as you progress.

After all `Sources(QUESTION i)` tasks are done, you MUST rewrite the TODO list:
- Replace the generic filter items with one `Filter(<product name>)` per discovered product (the count of Filter items must equal the number of products).
- Keep `Sort(filtered)` and the final write step after those filter items.

Example refreshed TODO after finding 3 products:
TODO List
- [ ] Filter(Product Alpha)
- [ ] Filter(Product Beta)
- [ ] Filter(Product Gamma)
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Write result to result.yaml

**Progress logging pattern (few-shot)**
- After EVERY action item, add an explicit “Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” item (and mark it done once you rewrite and overwrite the file).
- This enforces a rhythm of: do a step → record progress → rewrite TODO → update `new-product.json` → next step.
- Sample pattern the model should mirror:
  - [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Union(all source results)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sort(filtered)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Write result to new-product.json
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

**Final output format (what you actually return):**

- Return a **JSON array** of products, sorted from most to least interesting.
- Each entry MUST have the following fields:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "name": "<product name>",
      "url": "<official homepage>",
      "description": "1–3 sentence summary of what this product does, focused on the developer / AI-coding use case.",
      "release_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "category": "<short label, e.g. \"AI IDE\", \"AI coding CLI\", \"code agent\", \"workflow agent\">",
      "sources": ["Product Hunt", "Show HN", "Reddit", "X"],
      "community_quotes": [
        "<short quote from community describing what people like or notice>",
        "<up to 5 quotes total, can be paraphrased but must reflect real feedback>"
      ]
    }
  ]
```

* Only include products that:

  * You have **good evidence** were launched in the last 14 days, and
  * Clearly belong to the **AI coding / developer tools** space.

* If you cannot find any products that satisfy the 14-day constraint,
  return an empty JSON array: `[]`.

Be concise, factual, and avoid marketing fluff. Do **not** include your reasoning text
in the final answer—only the JSON.

**File output + incremental updates requirement**
- Maintain a file named `new-product` in the current working directory.
- After every step (including each “Record progress, rewrite todo”), write the current JSON array to `new-product` (overwrite). Early steps may be partial/rough; later steps should be refined.
- The JSON must always be valid and reflect the best current view (start with `[]` if nothing yet).
- After the final step, ensure `new-product` holds the final sorted array.

## Working Directory Context

Your current working directory is: `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2025-12-23`

All file operations should be relative to this directory.

---

Below is your QUESTION list. For each QUESTION, treat it as a separate “research lens”
to discover newly launched AI coding products (global constraint: last 14 days).

1. QUESTION 1
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that position themselves as a “full AI IDE” (similar to Windsurf or Cursor), not just a small autocomplete plugin.

2. QUESTION 2
   List newly launched AI coding CLIs or terminal-based agents from the last 14 days that behave like Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, or Claude Code CLI (repo-aware, can run commands, can manage tasks).

3. QUESTION 5
   List newly launched AI tools from the last 14 days that focus on one specific developer workflow (for example debugging, refactoring, test generation, or migration) instead of being a general-purpose coding assistant.

4. QUESTION 7
   List newly launched AI code agents from the last 14 days that advertise “project-long memory” or “workspace memory” across multiple sessions (not just single-chat context).

5. QUESTION 11
   List newly launched open-source AI coding agents from the last 14 days that can be self-hosted or run locally by developers.

6. QUESTION 14
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that integrate directly into existing IDEs (such as VS Code, JetBrains, or Neovim) rather than being a standalone IDE.

7. QUESTION 16
   List newly launched AI agents from the last 14 days that help developers run or orchestrate complex workflows across tools (for example CI/CD, deployment, observability, or incident response), rather than only editing code.

[assistant message #2]
I'll help you research newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days. Let me start by creating a TODO list to organize this research systematically.

      "Based on the search results for \"AI refactoring assistant December 2025 launch,\" I found several relevant articles about AI coding assistants, but **no specific mention of a new AI refactoring assistant launching in December 2025**.\n\nHere's what I found:\n\n## Current AI Coding Assistant Landscape (December 2025)\n\nThe search results show that AI coding assistants are already well-established in December 2025, with numerous tools available:\n\n**Popular AI Coding Assistants:**\n- **GitHub Copilot** - Microsoft announced \"agent mode\" at Build 2025, enabling autonomous multi-step tasks including code refactoring and test improvement\n- **Cursor** - Frequently mentioned as one of the top AI coding assistants\n- **Cline** - Listed among the best AI pair programmers\n- **AWS CodeWhisperer** - Continues to be a major player\n- **Safurai** - Specifically helps with coding, debugging, and refactoring; available as a VS Code extension\n\n## Key Features in 2025:\n- AI assistants now handle **code refactoring** as a core feature\n- **Agent v2** launched in February 2025, enabling users to build, debug, document, and deploy complete applications from a single prompt\n- Enhanced **context awareness** for understanding larger codebases\n- Tools can write, refactor, debug, and explain code across multiple languages and frameworks\n\n**Conclusion:** There doesn't appear to be a specific \"AI refactoring assistant\" launching in December 2025 mentioned in these results. Instead, refactoring capabilities are already integrated into existing AI coding assistants throughout 2025. If you're looking for a specific new product, you might want to search with more specific details about the company or product name."

Here are the key findings:\n\n## Recent VS Code AI Developments (Late 2025)\n\n### **VS Code 1.107 (November 2025 Update)** - Released December 10, 2025\n- **Multi-agent orchestration** for GitHub Copilot and custom agents\n- **Agent Sessions view** improvements (update 1.107.1)\n- Enhanced agent workflow capabilities\n- Source: [Visual Studio Magazine](https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2025/12/12/vs-code-1-107-november-2025-update-expands-multi-agent-orchestration-model-management.aspx)\n\n### **Major AI Features Throughout 2025:**\n- **Agent HQ** introduced in October 2025 (v1.106)\n- Integration with **OpenAI Codex** as a coding agent via command line and VS Code extension\n- **Unified agent experience** across VS Code\n- VS Code transitioning to an **\"open source AI editor\"**\n\n### **Key AI Coding Extensions Available in 2025:**\n1. **GitHub Copilot** - Deep integration with agent mode\n2. **OpenAI Codex** - Available as VS Code extension\n3. **Codeium** - Free AI coding assistant\n4. Other leading tools: Cursor, Windsurf, Bolt.new, Lovable AI, v0 by Vercel, Zencoder\n\n### **Context:**\n2025 has been described as the year **\"Agents took over VS Code,\"** with Microsoft shifting focus from simple autocomplete to full agentic AI capabilities. The trend shows movement toward **multi-agent orchestration** and agentic CLI tools.\n\n**Note**: Since the search results don't show a specific December 2025 launch announcement, you may want to clarify if you're looking for:\n- A specific new extension announcement\n- Updates to existing extensions\n- General AI coding features in the December VS Code release\n\nWould you like me to search for anything more specific?"

[assistant message #95]
Let me consolidate my findings and update my progress. Based on my research, I've found a few products that launched in December 2025. Let me update the file with my consolidated findings and then proceed with filtering:

[assistant message #98]
Based on my extensive research, I found that the search results primarily show products and updates from earlier in 2025 or late 2025 (November), with very few actual launches within the December 9-23, 2025 window. Let me consolidate my findings and provide a realistic assessment.

From my research, I found three products that launched in December 2025:
1. **Cursor Visual Editor** - December 11, 2025
2. **Kodey.ai** - December 1, 2025 (but this is outside the 14-day window from Dec 23)
3. **Morph** - December 9, 2025

Let me filter and finalize:

Now let me finalize the results. Based on my research within the 14-day window (December 9-23, 2025), I found only 2 products that clearly launched and meet the criteria:

1. **Cursor Visual Editor** - December 11, 2025 (within 14-day window)
2. **Morph** - December 9, 2025 (within 14-day window)

Kodey.ai (Dec 1) is outside the 14-day window. Let me write the final results:

[assistant message #106]
Based on my comprehensive research across Product Hunt, Hacker News, GitHub, and various tech news sources, I found only **2 products** that launched within the last 14 days (December 9-23, 2025) and clearly target AI coding/developer workflows:

## Summary of Findings

The research revealed that **December 2025 has been relatively quiet for new AI coding tool launches** within the 14-day window. Most activity in the AI coding space consisted of:

1. **Updates to existing tools** (e.g., Google Antigravity public preview, VS Code 1.107 updates, JetBrains AI plugin updates)
2. **Launches earlier in December** that are outside the 14-day window (e.g., Kodey.ai on Dec 1)
3. **Major launches from earlier in 2025** (Google Antigravity in November, various tools throughout 2025)

The two products that meet the criteria are:

### 1. **Cursor Visual Editor** (Launched December 11, 2025)
- **Category**: AI IDE enhancement
- **Key Features**: Visual AI agent tool for web app design using natural language and drag-and-drop
- **Significance**: Expands Cursor beyond pure coding into visual design, challenging Adobe and Figma

### 2. **Morph** (Launched December 9, 2025)
- **Category**: Code agent
- **Key Features**: Subagents for code generation with 10,500+ tokens/second processing speed
- **Significance**: Improves coding agent performance through fast apply models

The complete results have been written to `new-product.json`.
