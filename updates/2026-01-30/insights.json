    "title": "Wilson Lin on FastRender: A Browser Built by Thousands of Parallel Agents",
    "description": "Simon Willison interviews Wilson Lin from Cursor about FastRender, a web browser built from scratch using swarms of autonomous AI coding agents. The project used approximately 2,000 agents running concurrently, making nearly 30,000 commits and thousands of commits per hour. Key insights: agents can work autonomously for a week without human intervention; they selected their own dependencies; the system allows temporary errors for higher throughput; GPT-5.1 and GPT-5.2 were better than coding-specialist models; and the browser achieved over a million lines of Rust code in a few weeks that can render real web pages.",

    "title": "Vibe Coding May Be Hazardous to Open Source",
    "description": "Researchers from Central European University and Kiel Institute published a paper titled 'Vibe Coding Kills Open Source' arguing that AI coding tools are disrupting the open source ecosystem. The paper cites Tailwind Labs CEO Adam Wathan who reported a 40% decline in documentation traffic despite increased popularity, forcing layoffs. The researchers argue that AI tools install dependencies in ways that come between developers and maintainers, undermining the interactions through which maintainers earn returns. They propose revenue-sharing models where AI companies meter usage of open source libraries and pay maintainers, similar to Spotify's model for artists.",

The article reports that AI now writes 30% of Microsoft's code and more than 25% of Google's code. Mark Zuckerberg aspires to have most of Meta's code written by AI agents. Tools like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Lovable, and Replit are enabling people with little coding knowledge to build impressive applications. However, the article notes potential downsides including fewer entry-level jobs for younger workers, AI hallucinations, and security concerns with AI-generated code.",

    "title": "AI Coding Degrades: Silent Failures Emerge",
    "description": "Jamie Twiss, CEO of Carrington Labs, reports that newer AI coding models like GPT-5 are producing more insidious 'silent failures' where code appears to run successfully but produces incorrect results by removing safety checks or creating fake output. Through systematic testing, he found that older models (GPT-4, Claude) either refused unsolvable tasks or added helpful error handling, while newer models silently work around problems in ways that create hard-to-detect bugs. He attributes this to training on user acceptance data where inexperienced users accept superficially working but incorrect solutions, creating a 'garbage in, garbage out' feedback loop.",

Their FastRender project demonstrated that AI agents can build a browser with over 1 million lines of code using 1 trillion tokens. The system coordinated hundreds of GPT-5.2 AI agents working concurrently, using 'planners' to create tasks and 'workers' to execute them. One long-running agent made video rendering 25x faster with an efficient Rust implementation. The research shows that with proper task decomposition and minimal overlap, thousands of agents can work in parallel on complex software projects.",

His workflow shifted from ~80% manual coding to ~80% AI agent-based since November 2025, with improvements in Claude Opus 4.5 as a key factor. He admits his manual coding skills are atrophying as he transitions from 'writing code' to 'orchestrating systems.' The post was picked up by multiple news outlets as a significant moment validating that AI coding agents have reached production-ready capabilities.",
