[system]
You are an AI research analyst specialized in AI developer tools:
code agents, AI IDEs, AI coding CLIs, and related devtools.

Your **global goal**:
- Find genuinely new products that have been publicly launched in the **last 14 days**
- AND that clearly target **programming / code / AI dev workflows**
- THEN summarize only the valid ones in a **clean YAML list**.

You MUST treat the questions in the `user:` section as your **research QUESTION list**.
Each QUESTION is a different “angle” on the same market (e.g., full AI IDE, CLI, workflow-focused, etc.).

To organize your reasoning, use this formula:

> Answer = Sort( Filter( Union(Sources) ) )

You must conceptually follow these four stages:

1. **Sources → candidate list (per QUESTION)**
   - For each QUESTION from the `user:` section:
     - Search the web and relevant directories / launch pages.
     - Collect as many **candidate products** as are reasonably relevant.
   - For each candidate, internally track at least:
     - `name` (product name)
     - `url` (official homepage or primary landing page)
     - `description` (1–3 sentences in English summarizing what it does)
     - `sources` (which QUESTION(s) and which site(s) you saw it on)
   - At this stage you are allowed to over-collect; do **not** filter by date yet unless it is trivial.

2. **Union(candidates) → unified candidate set**
   - Merge candidates across all QUESTIONS into a single conceptual set:
     - Deduplicate products that clearly refer to the same thing
       (same URL, or obviously the same product name + branding).
   - After this step you have a unified **candidate pool**:
     - It may still contain old products, or products outside our domain.

3. **Filter(Union) → filtered candidate list**
   - For each product in the unified pool:
     - Investigate its **launch / first public release date** from credible public info
       (official site, launch post, Product Hunt / HN launch, blog, press, etc.).
     - Decide if it satisfies **both**:
       1) Launch date is within the last **14 days** (relative to “today”).
       2) Product is clearly related to **AI coding / code agents / IDE / dev workflows**.
   - If you cannot reasonably verify that the launch is within 14 days,
     **treat it as NOT valid** and exclude it.
   - Internally keep, for each surviving product:
     - `release_date` in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (best reasonable guess)
     - short one-line justification (do not put the justification in final YAML).

4. **Sort(filtered candidates) → final ordered list**
   - Only work with products that passed the filter.
   - Rank them by a simple mental score combining:
     - **recency** (more recent launch date is better),
     - **attention** (strong launch signal: PH upvotes, HN discussion, X/Reddit buzz),
     - **relevance** (how closely it fits “AI coding agent / IDE / devtool”).
   - You do not need to show the numeric score, just use it to order the list.


### Claude Code / todo-style planning requirements

When running inside Claude Code with access to a `todowrite` (or similar TODO-list) tool,
you MUST first externalize this plan as an explicit TODO list **before** doing any research.

Follow these rules:

0. Start with a planning item: add `Consider how to update todos based on products` as the very first TODO.

1. Based on the QUESTION list in the `user:` section, use the `todowrite` tool to create **one TODO item per QUESTION**.  
   - Each item should correspond to “Sources(QUESTION_i)” — i.e., collecting candidates for that QUESTION.

2. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Union** stage:  
   - e.g. “Union(all source results)” to merge candidates from all QUESTION-based source tasks.

3. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Filter** stage:  
   - e.g. “Filter(union) by launch date ≤ 14 days and AI coding relevance”.

4. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Sort** stage and final write-out:  
   - e.g. “Sort(filtered) and write result to result.yaml (or final-products.yaml)”.

A minimal example of the TODO list structure you are expected to build is (showing the alternating “record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” steps):

TODO List
- [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
...
- [ ] Union(sources from 1 to 3)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Write result to new-product.json
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

You may have more than 3 QUESTION-based source items (e.g. 7), but the pattern MUST be the same:
first all `Sources(QUESTION i)` items, then one `Union(...)`, one or more `Filter(...)` based on the number of unique products, one `Sort(...)`,
and finally one “write result” item.

You should use this TODO list as the execution plan and mark items as completed as you progress.

After all `Sources(QUESTION i)` tasks are done, you MUST rewrite the TODO list:
- Replace the generic filter items with one `Filter(<product name>)` per discovered product (the count of Filter items must equal the number of products).
- Keep `Sort(filtered)` and the final write step after those filter items.

Example refreshed TODO after finding 3 products:
TODO List
- [ ] Filter(Product Alpha)
- [ ] Filter(Product Beta)
- [ ] Filter(Product Gamma)
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Write result to result.yaml

**Progress logging pattern (few-shot)**
- After EVERY action item, add an explicit “Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” item (and mark it done once you rewrite and overwrite the file).
- This enforces a rhythm of: do a step → record progress → rewrite TODO → update `new-product.json` → next step.
- Sample pattern the model should mirror:
  - [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Union(all source results)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sort(filtered)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Write result to new-product.json
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

**Final output format (what you actually return):**

- Return a **JSON array** of products, sorted from most to least interesting.
- Each entry MUST have the following fields:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "name": "<product name>",
      "url": "<official homepage>",
      "description": "1–3 sentence summary of what this product does, focused on the developer / AI-coding use case.",
      "release_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "category": "<short label, e.g. \"AI IDE\", \"AI coding CLI\", \"code agent\", \"workflow agent\">",
      "sources": ["Product Hunt", "Show HN", "Reddit", "X"],
      "community_quotes": [
        "<short quote from community describing what people like or notice>",
        "<up to 5 quotes total, can be paraphrased but must reflect real feedback>"
      ]
    }
  ]
```

* Only include products that:

  * You have **good evidence** were launched in the last 14 days, and
  * Clearly belong to the **AI coding / developer tools** space.

* If you cannot find any products that satisfy the 14-day constraint,
  return an empty JSON array: `[]`.

Be concise, factual, and avoid marketing fluff. Do **not** include your reasoning text
in the final answer—only the JSON.

**File output + incremental updates requirement**
- Maintain a file named `new-product` in the current working directory.
- After every step (including each “Record progress, rewrite todo”), write the current JSON array to `new-product` (overwrite). Early steps may be partial/rough; later steps should be refined.
- The JSON must always be valid and reflect the best current view (start with `[]` if nothing yet).
- After the final step, ensure `new-product` holds the final sorted array.

## Working Directory Context

Your current working directory is: `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2026-02-06`

All file operations should be relative to this directory.

Below is your QUESTION list. For each QUESTION, treat it as a separate “research lens”
to discover newly launched AI coding products (global constraint: last 14 days).

1. QUESTION 1
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that position themselves as a “full AI IDE” (similar to Windsurf or Cursor), not just a small autocomplete plugin.

2. QUESTION 2
   List newly launched AI coding CLIs or terminal-based agents from the last 14 days that behave like Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, or Claude Code CLI (repo-aware, can run commands, can manage tasks).

3. QUESTION 5
   List newly launched AI tools from the last 14 days that focus on one specific developer workflow (for example debugging, refactoring, test generation, or migration) instead of being a general-purpose coding assistant.

4. QUESTION 7
   List newly launched AI code agents from the last 14 days that advertise “project-long memory” or “workspace memory” across multiple sessions (not just single-chat context).

5. QUESTION 11
   List newly launched open-source AI coding agents from the last 14 days that can be self-hosted or run locally by developers.

6. QUESTION 14
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that integrate directly into existing IDEs (such as VS Code, JetBrains, or Neovim) rather than being a standalone IDE.

7. QUESTION 16
   List newly launched AI agents from the last 14 days that help developers run or orchestrate complex workflows across tools (for example CI/CD, deployment, observability, or incident response), rather than only editing code.

[assistant message #2]
I'll help you research newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days. Let me start by creating a structured TODO list to track this research systematically.

[assistant message #67]
Based on my extensive research, I need to note that **today's date is February 6, 2026**. The last 14 days would be from **January 23, 2026 to February 6, 2026**. 

However, I'm finding that most of the search results are showing dates in January 2026 or earlier, which would be **outside the 14-day window**. Let me update the TODO list and create a summary based on what I've found:

Now let me analyze the candidates I found against the 14-day window (January 23 - February 6, 2026):

**Key Finding:** Most launches I found were in mid-January 2026 (January 16, 17, 20, etc.), which is **OUTSIDE** the 14-day window. However, I found one product that launched within the window:

Let me verify Seer's expansion more carefully:

[assistant message #77]
Now let me verify the dates for the products I found. Based on my research, the key product launches I identified were:

1. **Seer by Sentry** - Expanded on January 27, 2026 (within the last 14 days)
2. **Opsera DevOps Agents** - Launched early February 2026 (around February 2-3, 2026, which is within the last 14 days)
3. **Cursor CLI Agent Modes** - Launched January 16, 2026 (this is **outside** the 14-day window, which is Jan 23 - Feb 6, 2026)

Let me search for any additional products launched between January 23 - February 6, 2026:

        "text": "This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:\nAnalysis:\nLet me chronologically analyze the conversation to capture all details:\n\n1. **Initial Request**: User provided a working directory context and a list of 7 QUESTIONS about newly launched AI coding products from the last 14 days. Each question represents a different \"research lens\" to discover products.\n\n2. **My Initial Actions**:\n   - Created a TODO list to track research progress across all 7 questions\n   - Created an empty `new-product.json` file\n   - Started searching for AI IDEs, CLI tools, and other AI coding products\n\n3. **Search Strategy**: I conducted extensive web searches across multiple categories:\n   - Full AI IDEs (Question 1)\n   - AI coding CLIs/terminal agents (Question 2)\n   - Workflow-specific AI tools (Question 5)\n   - AI code agents with project memory (Question 7)\n   - Open-source AI coding agents (Question 11)\n   - AI tools integrating into existing IDEs (Question 14)\n   - AI workflow orchestration agents (Question 16)\n\n4. **Date Window Clarification**: Midway through, I realized the current date is February 6, 2026, so the \"last 14 days\" window is January 23 - February 6, 2026. Many launches I found (like Cursor CLI Agent Modes on January 16) were outside this window.\n\n5. **Key Findings**: I found three products that launched within the 14-day window:\n   - **Seer by Sentry** - Expanded January 27, 2026 (AI debugging agent)\n   - **OpenAI Codex Desktop App** - Launched January 29, 2026 (macOS app for multi-agent coding)\n   - **Opsera DevOps Agents** - Launched February 3, 2026 (Agentic DevOps platform)\n\n6. **Final Actions**:\n   - Updated TODO list to reflect completed searches\n   - Used webReader to get detailed information from official sources\n   - Was in the process of filtering and writing results to new-product.json\n\n7. **User's Final Request**: Asked for a detailed summary of the conversation.\n\nSummary:\n1. **Primary Request and Intent**:\n   - Research newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days (January 23 - February 6, 2026) across 7 specific categories:\n     1. Full AI IDEs (like Windsurf/Cursor)\n     2. AI coding CLIs/terminal agents\n     3. Workflow-specific AI tools (debugging, refactoring, test generation, migration)\n     4. AI code agents with project/workspace memory\n     5. Open-source AI coding agents\n     6. AI tools integrating into existing IDEs (VS Code, JetBrains, Neovim)\n     7. AI workflow orchestration agents (CI/CD, deployment, observability, incident response)\n   - Filter results by launch date (≤14 days) and AI coding relevance\n   - Sort and write final results to `new-product.json`\n   - Include source citations with markdown hyperlinks for all findings\n\n2. **Key Technical Concepts**:\n   - AI-powered IDEs vs. IDE extensions/plugins\n   - CLI-based coding agents with repo-awareness\n   - Agentic AI vs. autocomplete assistants\n   - Multi-agent development and orchestration\n   - AI debugging with production telemetry\n   - DevOps automation and CI/CD orchestration\n   - Model Context Protocol (MCP)\n   - Workspace/project memory across sessions\n   - Local development debugging with AI\n   - Autonomous remediation in DevOps\n\n3. **Files and Code Sections**:\n   - **`/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2026-02-06/new-product.json`**\n     - Created as empty array `[]` to store final results\n     - Purpose: Output file for filtered and sorted product launches\n     - Last updated with empty array, pending final product entries\n     ```json\n     []\n     ```\n\n   - **Sources researched via webReader** (read but not saved to files):\n     - `https://openai.com/index/introducing-the-codex-app/` - OpenAI Codex Desktop App details\n     - `https://sentry.io/about/press-releases/sentry-expands-seer-ai-debugging-agent/` - Seer expansion announcement\n     - `https://www.morningstar.com/news/pr-newswire/20260203la77193/opsera-launches-new-advanced-reasoning-ai-and-autonomous-remediation-agents-for-agentic-devops` - Opsera launch details\n\n4. **Errors and Fixes**:\n   - **Initial date confusion**: Initially searched for \"January 2026\" launches broadly. Fixed by calculating the specific 14-day window (January 23 - February 6, 2026) based on current date February 6, 2026.\n   - **Products outside date window**: Found Cursor CLI Agent Modes (January 16, 2026) which was outside the 14-day window. Fixed by filtering these out and focusing on launches from January 27 onwards.\n   - **No specific date searches**: Initial searches were too broad. Fixed by running targeted searches for specific date ranges (Jan 23-26, 27-30, 31-Feb 3).\n\n5. **Problem Solving**:\n   - **Challenge**: Finding actual product launch dates within a very specific 14-day window\n   - **Solution**: Conducted multiple targeted searches with specific date ranges and verified launch dates through official press releases and product announcements\n   - **Challenge**: Differentiating between new launches vs. updates/reviews of existing products\n   - **Solution**: Focused on official press releases, \"Show HN\" posts, Product Hunt launches, and verified launch announcements\n   - **Challenge**: Ensuring products match specific question categories\n   - **Solution**: Mapped each found product to relevant categories (e.g., Seer for debugging, Opsera for DevOps orchestration)\n\n6. **All User Messages**:\n   - Initial message with working directory context and 7 QUESTIONS for researching AI coding tools\n   - Summary request asking for detailed conversation analysis\n\n7. **Pending Tasks**:\n   - Complete filtering and sorting of the 3 identified products (Seer, OpenAI Codex app, Opsera)\n   - Write final structured results to `new-product.json` with all required fields\n   - Map each product to relevant question categories\n   - Include proper markdown hyperlinks to sources for each product\n\n8. **Current Work**:\n   I was in the process of finalizing research results after identifying 3 products launched within the 14-day window (January 23 - February 6, 2026):\n   \n   - **Seer by Sentry** (January 27, 2026) - AI debugging agent expansion to local development and code review\n   - **OpenAI Codex Desktop App** (January 29, 2026) - macOS app for multi-agent development with parallel workflows\n   - **Opsera DevOps Agents** (February 3, 2026) - Agentic DevOps platform with autonomous remediation\n   \n   I had just completed webReader calls to gather detailed information from official sources and updated the TODO list to show filtering as completed. The next step was to compile these findings into the `new-product.json` file with proper categorization according to the 7 questions.\n\n   TODO status before summary request:\n   ```\n   - [completed] All source searches across 7 questions\n   - [completed] Filtering of Seer, Opsera, and OpenAI Codex app\n   - [in_progress] Sort(filtered) and write final result to new-product.json\n   - [pending] Record final progress\n   ```\n\n9. **Optional Next Step**:\n   Based on the task immediately before the summary request, the next step is to write the final results to `new-product.json` with the 3 identified products, properly categorized and formatted. This directly continues the research task that was in progress.\n   \n   Direct quote from my TODO list: \"Sort(filtered) and write final result to new-product.json\" was marked as \"in_progress\" when the summary was requested..\nPlease continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on."
