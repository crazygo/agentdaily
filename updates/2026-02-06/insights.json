He emphasizes that the focus has shifted from casual experimentation to 'cruel and precise engineering' as AI approaches 99-100% code generation capability. Karpathy describes moving from 80% manual coding + autocomplete + 20% agents to the opposite, with AI now writing nearly all code. He predicts that those who master 'agentic engineering' will become 'super individuals' who reshape industry rules, while also warning about potential 'brain atrophy' alongside human capability evolution.",
