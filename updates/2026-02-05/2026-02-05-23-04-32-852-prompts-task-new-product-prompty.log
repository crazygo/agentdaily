[system]
You are an AI research analyst specialized in AI developer tools:
code agents, AI IDEs, AI coding CLIs, and related devtools.

Your **global goal**:
- Find genuinely new products that have been publicly launched in the **last 14 days**
- AND that clearly target **programming / code / AI dev workflows**
- THEN summarize only the valid ones in a **clean YAML list**.

You MUST treat the questions in the `user:` section as your **research QUESTION list**.
Each QUESTION is a different “angle” on the same market (e.g., full AI IDE, CLI, workflow-focused, etc.).

To organize your reasoning, use this formula:

> Answer = Sort( Filter( Union(Sources) ) )

You must conceptually follow these four stages:

1. **Sources → candidate list (per QUESTION)**
   - For each QUESTION from the `user:` section:
     - Search the web and relevant directories / launch pages.
     - Collect as many **candidate products** as are reasonably relevant.
   - For each candidate, internally track at least:
     - `name` (product name)
     - `url` (official homepage or primary landing page)
     - `description` (1–3 sentences in English summarizing what it does)
     - `sources` (which QUESTION(s) and which site(s) you saw it on)
   - At this stage you are allowed to over-collect; do **not** filter by date yet unless it is trivial.

2. **Union(candidates) → unified candidate set**
   - Merge candidates across all QUESTIONS into a single conceptual set:
     - Deduplicate products that clearly refer to the same thing
       (same URL, or obviously the same product name + branding).
   - After this step you have a unified **candidate pool**:
     - It may still contain old products, or products outside our domain.

3. **Filter(Union) → filtered candidate list**
   - For each product in the unified pool:
     - Investigate its **launch / first public release date** from credible public info
       (official site, launch post, Product Hunt / HN launch, blog, press, etc.).
     - Decide if it satisfies **both**:
       1) Launch date is within the last **14 days** (relative to “today”).
       2) Product is clearly related to **AI coding / code agents / IDE / dev workflows**.
   - If you cannot reasonably verify that the launch is within 14 days,
     **treat it as NOT valid** and exclude it.
   - Internally keep, for each surviving product:
     - `release_date` in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (best reasonable guess)
     - short one-line justification (do not put the justification in final YAML).

4. **Sort(filtered candidates) → final ordered list**
   - Only work with products that passed the filter.
   - Rank them by a simple mental score combining:
     - **recency** (more recent launch date is better),
     - **attention** (strong launch signal: PH upvotes, HN discussion, X/Reddit buzz),
     - **relevance** (how closely it fits “AI coding agent / IDE / devtool”).
   - You do not need to show the numeric score, just use it to order the list.


### Claude Code / todo-style planning requirements

When running inside Claude Code with access to a `todowrite` (or similar TODO-list) tool,
you MUST first externalize this plan as an explicit TODO list **before** doing any research.

Follow these rules:

0. Start with a planning item: add `Consider how to update todos based on products` as the very first TODO.

1. Based on the QUESTION list in the `user:` section, use the `todowrite` tool to create **one TODO item per QUESTION**.  
   - Each item should correspond to “Sources(QUESTION_i)” — i.e., collecting candidates for that QUESTION.

2. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Union** stage:  
   - e.g. “Union(all source results)” to merge candidates from all QUESTION-based source tasks.

3. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Filter** stage:  
   - e.g. “Filter(union) by launch date ≤ 14 days and AI coding relevance”.

4. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Sort** stage and final write-out:  
   - e.g. “Sort(filtered) and write result to result.yaml (or final-products.yaml)”.

A minimal example of the TODO list structure you are expected to build is (showing the alternating “record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” steps):

TODO List
- [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
...
- [ ] Union(sources from 1 to 3)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Write result to new-product.json
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

You may have more than 3 QUESTION-based source items (e.g. 7), but the pattern MUST be the same:
first all `Sources(QUESTION i)` items, then one `Union(...)`, one or more `Filter(...)` based on the number of unique products, one `Sort(...)`,
and finally one “write result” item.

You should use this TODO list as the execution plan and mark items as completed as you progress.

After all `Sources(QUESTION i)` tasks are done, you MUST rewrite the TODO list:
- Replace the generic filter items with one `Filter(<product name>)` per discovered product (the count of Filter items must equal the number of products).
- Keep `Sort(filtered)` and the final write step after those filter items.

Example refreshed TODO after finding 3 products:
TODO List
- [ ] Filter(Product Alpha)
- [ ] Filter(Product Beta)
- [ ] Filter(Product Gamma)
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Write result to result.yaml

**Progress logging pattern (few-shot)**
- After EVERY action item, add an explicit “Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” item (and mark it done once you rewrite and overwrite the file).
- This enforces a rhythm of: do a step → record progress → rewrite TODO → update `new-product.json` → next step.
- Sample pattern the model should mirror:
  - [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Union(all source results)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sort(filtered)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Write result to new-product.json
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

**Final output format (what you actually return):**

- Return a **JSON array** of products, sorted from most to least interesting.
- Each entry MUST have the following fields:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "name": "<product name>",
      "url": "<official homepage>",
      "description": "1–3 sentence summary of what this product does, focused on the developer / AI-coding use case.",
      "release_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "category": "<short label, e.g. \"AI IDE\", \"AI coding CLI\", \"code agent\", \"workflow agent\">",
      "sources": ["Product Hunt", "Show HN", "Reddit", "X"],
      "community_quotes": [
        "<short quote from community describing what people like or notice>",
        "<up to 5 quotes total, can be paraphrased but must reflect real feedback>"
      ]
    }
  ]
```

* Only include products that:

  * You have **good evidence** were launched in the last 14 days, and
  * Clearly belong to the **AI coding / developer tools** space.

* If you cannot find any products that satisfy the 14-day constraint,
  return an empty JSON array: `[]`.

Be concise, factual, and avoid marketing fluff. Do **not** include your reasoning text
in the final answer—only the JSON.

**File output + incremental updates requirement**
- Maintain a file named `new-product` in the current working directory.
- After every step (including each “Record progress, rewrite todo”), write the current JSON array to `new-product` (overwrite). Early steps may be partial/rough; later steps should be refined.
- The JSON must always be valid and reflect the best current view (start with `[]` if nothing yet).
- After the final step, ensure `new-product` holds the final sorted array.

## Working Directory Context

Your current working directory is: `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2026-02-05`

All file operations should be relative to this directory.

Below is your QUESTION list. For each QUESTION, treat it as a separate “research lens”
to discover newly launched AI coding products (global constraint: last 14 days).

1. QUESTION 1
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that position themselves as a “full AI IDE” (similar to Windsurf or Cursor), not just a small autocomplete plugin.

2. QUESTION 2
   List newly launched AI coding CLIs or terminal-based agents from the last 14 days that behave like Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, or Claude Code CLI (repo-aware, can run commands, can manage tasks).

3. QUESTION 5
   List newly launched AI tools from the last 14 days that focus on one specific developer workflow (for example debugging, refactoring, test generation, or migration) instead of being a general-purpose coding assistant.

4. QUESTION 7
   List newly launched AI code agents from the last 14 days that advertise “project-long memory” or “workspace memory” across multiple sessions (not just single-chat context).

5. QUESTION 11
   List newly launched open-source AI coding agents from the last 14 days that can be self-hosted or run locally by developers.

6. QUESTION 14
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that integrate directly into existing IDEs (such as VS Code, JetBrains, or Neovim) rather than being a standalone IDE.

7. QUESTION 16
   List newly launched AI agents from the last 14 days that help developers run or orchestrate complex workflows across tools (for example CI/CD, deployment, observability, or incident response), rather than only editing code.

[assistant message #2]

A new AI chip designed to make AI cheaper and faster, with improved token generation\n- **DeepSeek AI** released DeepSeek-OCR-2, a 3-billion parameter model\n- **JDoodle.ai** launched (featured on Product Hunt) - allows pasting website URLs, uploading images, or Figma designs to get editable starting points\n- **AI coding agents** gained enhanced multi-file editing capabilities and better repository awareness\n\n## **January 28, 2026**\n- **Anthropic released \"Claude Cowork\"** - A new desktop tool that lets users work with AI agents directly in files without needing to write code\n- **Arcee AI** (a 30-person U.S. startup) released a new AI tool\n- **Google DeepMind launched AlphaGenome** - An AI tool to help identify genetic drivers of disease, capable of analyzing up to 1 million letters of DNA code at once\n\n## **January 29, 2026**\n- **OpenAI launched a Codex desktop app for macOS** - Enables developers to run multiple AI coding agents in parallel\n- **Google DeepMind's AlphaGenome** was also highlighted on this date\n- **Cursor AI** and other developer tools were noted as launching\n\n## **January 30, 2026**\n- **Anthropic brought agentic plug-ins to Cowork** - An expansion of their earlier Claude Cowork launch\n- **Anthropic's Opus 4.6** was announced - Features 1M token context and \"agent teams\"\n- **Coder released AI Maturity Self-Assessment and AI Maturity Curve** - Tools to help software development teams assess their AI capabilities\n\nThe most significant launch appears to be **Anthropic's Claude Cowork** on January 28th, which was reportedly a major enough development that it caused substantial volatility in software stocks when the plug-ins were announced on January 30th.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

      "Based on the search results, I found information about **Doctective**, which is indeed an auto-documentation tool that launched in January 2026. Here's what I found:\n\n## Doctective - Overview\n\n**Launch Date:** January 26-27, 2026\n\n**Tagline:** \"Install once, document forever. Auto-updates all your documentation from your code so they never go stale.\"\n\n## Key Features\n\n1. **Auto-Updating Documentation**: Automatically updates documentation directly from your code to prevent it from becoming outdated\n\n2. **Change Detection**: Detects when code changes break your documentation\n\n3. **PR Analysis**: Analyzes every pull request to catch stale documentation before it ships\n\n4. **Code Sync**: Keeps documentation always in sync with your codebase\n\n5. **Enterprise-Ready**: Capable of auto-documenting entire organizations\n\n## Problem It Solves\n\nDoctective addresses the chronic \"documentation out of sync\" problem by using AI to automatically update docs when code changes occur, eliminating the need for manual documentation updates.\n\n## Launch Performance\n\nThe tool was featured on Product Hunt on January 26-27, 2026, receiving significant attention with over 100+ upvotes on its launch day.\n\n## Official Website\n\n- **Website**: https://doctective.app/\n- **Product Hunt**: Available for more details and community engagement\n\nThis tool appears to be designed for developers who want to maintain accurate, up-to-date documentation without the tedious manual process of updating docs every time code changes."

Here are the key findings:\n\n## Recent Terminal-Based AI Coding Assistants\n\n### 1. **Auggie CLI by Augment**\n- **Launch Date:** September 12, 2025\n- **Description:** An AI coding agent specifically designed for terminal use, focused on enhancing team collaboration and efficiency in software development\n- **Source:** [Hacker Noon](https://hackernoon.com/auggie-cli-marks-augments-push-into-terminal-based-ai-development)\n\n### 2. **Open Code (Crush CLI)**\n- **Update Date:** August 2025\n- **Description:** A revolutionary terminal-based AI coding assistant that transforms the command line into an intelligent workspace. Also known as \"Crush,\" it's a Go-based CLI application with a terminal user interface (TUI) for AI coding\n- **Source:** [WordPress](https://atalupadhyay.wordpress.com/2025/06/16/open-code-building-your-ultimate-terminal-based-ai-coding-assistant/) | [The New Stack](https://thenewstack.io/terminal-user-interfaces-review-of-crush-ex-opencode-al/)\n\n### 3. **Cursor CLI**\n- **Description:** A terminal-based AI assistant designed to help developers write, review, debug, and test code directly from the command line\n- **Source:** [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/article/getting-started-with-cursor-cli)\n\n### 4. **Aider**\n- **Description:** AI pair programming tool that runs in your terminal, allowing developers to work with LLMs on new or existing codebases\n- **Source:** [aider.chat](https://aider.chat/)\n\n### 5. **OpenAI Codex CLI**\n- **Description:** A lightweight coding agent from OpenAI that runs locally on your computer in the terminal\n- **Source:** [GitHub](https://github.com/openai/codex)\n\n## Note\nThe search results show articles from 2025, but no specific terminal-based AI coding assistant launch was found for January 2026. The most recent launches mentioned are from September 2025 (Auggie CLI) and earlier in 2025. It's possible that:\n\n1. The January 2026 launch may be too recent to appear in search results\n2. The specific tool you're looking for might not be widely documented yet\n3. The launch date might be different from January 2026\n\nWould you like me to search for any specific company or product name you have in mind?"

Rather than starting each session by re-explaining the same information, Knowns CLI maintains context automatically, allowing for seamless continuation of work across coding sessions.\n\n### Product Hunt Presence:\n- Main product page available on Product Hunt\n- Has a dedicated launches page for 2026\n- Listed among alternatives alongside other developer tools like:\n  - Claude Code\n  - Warp\n  - Kodingo\n  - Codebuff\n\nThe tool appears to be positioned as a productivity enhancement for developers and technical teams who work with AI coding assistants, helping them maintain continuity and context across multiple coding sessions.\n\n**Links available:**\n- [Product Hunt Main Page](https://www.producthunt.com/products/knowns-cli)\n- [Launches Page](https://www.producthunt.com/products/knowns-cli/launches)"

I see - Shotgun CLI launched in September 2025, so it's outside our 14-day window. But Knowns CLI launched on January 14, 2026, which is within our range! Let me now continue with the remaining questions. Due to time constraints, let me accelerate by searching for all remaining questions in parallel:

[assistant message #105]
Now let me verify the launch dates and filter to ensure everything is within the last 14 days. Since "today" appears to be February 5, 2026, I need to ensure all products were launched between January 22, 2026 and February 5, 2026. Let me verify and filter:
