You are an AI research analyst specialized in AI developer tools:
code agents, AI IDEs, AI coding CLIs, and related devtools.

Your **global goal**:
- Find genuinely new products that have been publicly launched in the **last 14 days**
- AND that clearly target **programming / code / AI dev workflows**
- THEN summarize only the valid ones in a **clean YAML list**.

You MUST treat the questions in the `user:` section as your **research QUESTION list**.
Each QUESTION is a different “angle” on the same market (e.g., full AI IDE, CLI, workflow-focused, etc.).

To organize your reasoning, use this formula:

> Answer = Sort( Filter( Union(Sources) ) )

You must conceptually follow these four stages:

1. **Sources → candidate list (per QUESTION)**
   - For each QUESTION from the `user:` section:
     - Search the web and relevant directories / launch pages.
     - Collect as many **candidate products** as are reasonably relevant.
   - For each candidate, internally track at least:
     - `name` (product name)
     - `url` (official homepage or primary landing page)
     - `description` (1–3 sentences in English summarizing what it does)
     - `sources` (which QUESTION(s) and which site(s) you saw it on)
   - At this stage you are allowed to over-collect; do **not** filter by date yet unless it is trivial.

2. **Union(candidates) → unified candidate set**
   - Merge candidates across all QUESTIONS into a single conceptual set:
     - Deduplicate products that clearly refer to the same thing
       (same URL, or obviously the same product name + branding).
   - After this step you have a unified **candidate pool**:
     - It may still contain old products, or products outside our domain.

3. **Filter(Union) → filtered candidate list**
   - For each product in the unified pool:
     - Investigate its **launch / first public release date** from credible public info
       (official site, launch post, Product Hunt / HN launch, blog, press, etc.).
     - Decide if it satisfies **both**:
       1) Launch date is within the last **14 days** (relative to “today”).
       2) Product is clearly related to **AI coding / code agents / IDE / dev workflows**.
   - If you cannot reasonably verify that the launch is within 14 days,
     **treat it as NOT valid** and exclude it.
   - Internally keep, for each surviving product:
     - `release_date` in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (best reasonable guess)
     - short one-line justification (do not put the justification in final YAML).

4. **Sort(filtered candidates) → final ordered list**
   - Only work with products that passed the filter.
   - Rank them by a simple mental score combining:
     - **recency** (more recent launch date is better),
     - **attention** (strong launch signal: PH upvotes, HN discussion, X/Reddit buzz),
     - **relevance** (how closely it fits “AI coding agent / IDE / devtool”).
   - You do not need to show the numeric score, just use it to order the list.


### Claude Code / todo-style planning requirements

When running inside Claude Code with access to a `todowrite` (or similar TODO-list) tool,
you MUST first externalize this plan as an explicit TODO list **before** doing any research.

Follow these rules:

0. Start with a planning item: add `Consider how to update todos based on products` as the very first TODO.

1. Based on the QUESTION list in the `user:` section, use the `todowrite` tool to create **one TODO item per QUESTION**.  
   - Each item should correspond to “Sources(QUESTION_i)” — i.e., collecting candidates for that QUESTION.

2. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Union** stage:  
   - e.g. “Union(all source results)” to merge candidates from all QUESTION-based source tasks.

3. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Filter** stage:  
   - e.g. “Filter(union) by launch date ≤ 14 days and AI coding relevance”.

4. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Sort** stage and final write-out:  
   - e.g. “Sort(filtered) and write result to result.yaml (or final-products.yaml)”.

A minimal example of the TODO list structure you are expected to build is (showing the alternating “record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” steps):

TODO List
- [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
...
- [ ] Union(sources from 1 to 3)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Write result to new-product.json
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

You may have more than 3 QUESTION-based source items (e.g. 7), but the pattern MUST be the same:
first all `Sources(QUESTION i)` items, then one `Union(...)`, one or more `Filter(...)` based on the number of unique products, one `Sort(...)`,
and finally one “write result” item.

You should use this TODO list as the execution plan and mark items as completed as you progress.

After all `Sources(QUESTION i)` tasks are done, you MUST rewrite the TODO list:
- Replace the generic filter items with one `Filter(<product name>)` per discovered product (the count of Filter items must equal the number of products).
- Keep `Sort(filtered)` and the final write step after those filter items.

Example refreshed TODO after finding 3 products:
TODO List
- [ ] Filter(Product Alpha)
- [ ] Filter(Product Beta)
- [ ] Filter(Product Gamma)
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Write result to result.yaml

**Progress logging pattern (few-shot)**
- After EVERY action item, add an explicit “Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” item (and mark it done once you rewrite and overwrite the file).
- This enforces a rhythm of: do a step → record progress → rewrite TODO → update `new-product.json` → next step.
- Sample pattern the model should mirror:
  - [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Union(all source results)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sort(filtered)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Write result to new-product.json
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

**Final output format (what you actually return):**

- Return a **JSON array** of products, sorted from most to least interesting.
- Each entry MUST have the following fields:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "name": "<product name>",
      "url": "<official homepage>",
      "description": "1–3 sentence summary of what this product does, focused on the developer / AI-coding use case.",
      "release_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "category": "<short label, e.g. \"AI IDE\", \"AI coding CLI\", \"code agent\", \"workflow agent\">",
      "sources": ["Product Hunt", "Show HN", "Reddit", "X"],
      "community_quotes": [
        "<short quote from community describing what people like or notice>",
        "<up to 5 quotes total, can be paraphrased but must reflect real feedback>"
      ]
    }
  ]
```

* Only include products that:

  * You have **good evidence** were launched in the last 14 days, and
  * Clearly belong to the **AI coding / developer tools** space.

* If you cannot find any products that satisfy the 14-day constraint,
  return an empty JSON array: `[]`.

Be concise, factual, and avoid marketing fluff. Do **not** include your reasoning text
in the final answer—only the JSON.

**File output + incremental updates requirement**
- Maintain a file named `new-product` in the current working directory.
- After every step (including each “Record progress, rewrite todo”), write the current JSON array to `new-product` (overwrite). Early steps may be partial/rough; later steps should be refined.
- The JSON must always be valid and reflect the best current view (start with `[]` if nothing yet).
- After the final step, ensure `new-product` holds the final sorted array.

## Working Directory Context

Your current working directory is: `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2026-02-20`

All file operations should be relative to this directory.

---

Below is your QUESTION list. For each QUESTION, treat it as a separate “research lens”
to discover newly launched AI coding products (global constraint: last 14 days).

1. QUESTION 1
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that position themselves as a “full AI IDE” (similar to Windsurf or Cursor), not just a small autocomplete plugin.

2. QUESTION 2
   List newly launched AI coding CLIs or terminal-based agents from the last 14 days that behave like Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, or Claude Code CLI (repo-aware, can run commands, can manage tasks).

3. QUESTION 5
   List newly launched AI tools from the last 14 days that focus on one specific developer workflow (for example debugging, refactoring, test generation, or migration) instead of being a general-purpose coding assistant.

4. QUESTION 7
   List newly launched AI code agents from the last 14 days that advertise “project-long memory” or “workspace memory” across multiple sessions (not just single-chat context).

5. QUESTION 11
   List newly launched open-source AI coding agents from the last 14 days that can be self-hosted or run locally by developers.

6. QUESTION 14
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that integrate directly into existing IDEs (such as VS Code, JetBrains, or Neovim) rather than being a standalone IDE.

7. QUESTION 16
   List newly launched AI agents from the last 14 days that help developers run or orchestrate complex workflows across tools (for example CI/CD, deployment, observability, or incident response), rather than only editing code.

[assistant message #2]

Here's what I found:\n\n## Key Findings:\n\n**1. OpenAI Codex CLI**\n- **Launch Date**: April 17, 2025 (not February 2026)\n- OpenAI released an open-source terminal programming assistant\n- Allows developers to use natural language in the terminal to develop projects\n- Features multi-modal support, accepting screenshots or draft images for AI to build projects quickly\n- Gained significant attention: over 5,000 GitHub stars within 5 hours of launch\n\n**2. Other AI Coding CLI Tools Mentioned (2026 context):**\n- **Claude Code** (Anthropic) - Strong at logical refactoring, has shell permissions\n- **Gemini CLI** (Google) - Features 1M-2M token context windows for engineering audits\n- **Kimi CLI** (Moonshot AI) - Command-line general agent tool\n\n**3. 2026 AI Programming CLI Trend:**\nThe search results indicate that in 2026, there's a shift from IDE \"completion plugins\" to CLI-based \"agentic execution\" - moving from passive assistance to active agents that can autonomously fix errors and run tests.\n\n**Note**: The search didn't find specific articles from Hacker News or r/programming about a February 2026 launch. It's possible that:\n1. The specific domain filter syntax used didn't work as expected\n2. There may not be posts about a February 2026 launch on those specific platforms\n3. The launch information might be referenced differently or on other platforms\n\nWould you like me to search with different parameters or broaden the search criteria?\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

The search didn't return any results specifically from Hacker News (news.ycombinator.com) or Reddit's r/programming, despite the domain filter I attempted to use.\n\nHowever, the search did return relevant information about AI coding CLI tools. Here's what I found:\n\n## Key Findings:\n\n**1. OpenAI Codex CLI**\n- **Launch Date**: April 17, 2025 (not February 2026)\n- OpenAI released an open-source terminal programming assistant\n- Allows developers to use natural language in the terminal to develop projects\n- Features multi-modal support, accepting screenshots or draft images for AI to build projects quickly\n- Gained significant attention: over 5,000 GitHub stars within 5 hours of launch\n\n**2. Other AI Coding CLI Tools Mentioned (2026 context):**\n- **Claude Code** (Anthropic) - Strong at logical refactoring, has shell permissions\n- **Gemini CLI** (Google) - Features 1M-2M token context windows for engineering audits\n- **Kimi CLI** (Moonshot AI) - Command-line general agent tool\n\n**3. 2026 AI Programming CLI Trend:**\nThe search results indicate that in 2026, there's a shift from IDE \"completion plugins\" to CLI-based \"agentic execution\" - moving from passive assistance to active agents that can autonomously fix errors and run tests.\n\n**Note**: The search didn't find specific articles from Hacker News or r/programming about a February 2026 launch. It's possible that:\n1. The specific domain filter syntax used didn't work as expected\n2. There may not be posts about a February 2026 launch on those specific platforms\n3. The launch information might be referenced differently or on other platforms\n\nWould you like me to search with different parameters or broaden the search criteria?"

Hacker News Activity (Feb 8, 2026)**\n- A notable \"Ask HN: What are you working on?\" thread showed frequent mentions of \"Claude Code,\" \"Opus 4.6,\" \"AI Agent,\" and \"vibe coding\"\n- Developers were showcasing how AI writes code for them, along with their struggles managing AI-generated code\n\n**2. Notable AI Coding Projects**\n- **Prompter Hawk**: An AI agent task scheduling dashboard by developer nlowell, featuring parallel session monitoring, cost analysis, automatic retry, and Mermaid architecture diagram generation\n- The developer noted they hadn't posted a \"Show HN\" yet due to poor landing page conversion rates—a common 2026 challenge\n\n**3. Major Model Releases (February 11, 2026)**\nChinese AI companies made significant releases:\n- **Zhipu AI GLM-5**: 745B parameters (MoE architecture), strong focus on complex coding and autonomous agents\n- **DeepSeek**: Quietly released a new model version\n- **MiniMax M2.5**: New model launch\n\n**4. Agentic Coding Evolution**\n- AI coding is moving beyond simple code completion to project-level autonomous agents\n- Projects can consume millions of tokens per task (1000x more than traditional chat)\n- Spec-driven development has become extremely popular, using \"Markdown scaffolding\" oriented toward agents\n\n**5. Market Maturation**\n- GitHub Copilot maintains ~82% code completion accuracy\n- Focus has shifted from \"can AI write code?\" to \"how do we integrate AI into professional software engineering workflows?\"\n- 2026 is seen as the inflection point for AI agent reasoning at scale\n\nThe search results suggest that February 2026 was indeed an active month for AI coding agent developments, though specific \"Show HN\" posts weren't directly captured in these results. The focus appears to be on the broader ecosystem maturation rather than individual project launches.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

      "Based on the search results for \"Show HN\" AI coding agent in February 2026, here's what I found:\n\n## Summary of February 2026 AI Coding Agent Landscape\n\n### Industry Context\n- **2026 is being called \"the breakout year for AI Agents\"**, with the global AI Agent core market expected to reach $18.7 billion and China's market exceeding 48 billion yuan\n- By the end of 2026, 40% of enterprise software is predicted to have built-in AI Agent capabilities\n\n### Key Trends and Discussions\n\n**1. Hacker News Activity (Feb 8, 2026)**\n- A notable \"Ask HN: What are you working on?\" thread showed frequent mentions of \"Claude Code,\" \"Opus 4.6,\" \"AI Agent,\" and \"vibe coding\"\n- Developers were showcasing how AI writes code for them, along with their struggles managing AI-generated code\n\n**2. Notable AI Coding Projects**\n- **Prompter Hawk**: An AI agent task scheduling dashboard by developer nlowell, featuring parallel session monitoring, cost analysis, automatic retry, and Mermaid architecture diagram generation\n- The developer noted they hadn't posted a \"Show HN\" yet due to poor landing page conversion rates—a common 2026 challenge\n\n**3. Major Model Releases (February 11, 2026)**\nChinese AI companies made significant releases:\n- **Zhipu AI GLM-5**: 745B parameters (MoE architecture), strong focus on complex coding and autonomous agents\n- **DeepSeek**: Quietly released a new model version\n- **MiniMax M2.5**: New model launch\n\n**4. Agentic Coding Evolution**\n- AI coding is moving beyond simple code completion to project-level autonomous agents\n- Projects can consume millions of tokens per task (1000x more than traditional chat)\n- Spec-driven development has become extremely popular, using \"Markdown scaffolding\" oriented toward agents\n\n**5. Market Maturation**\n- GitHub Copilot maintains ~82% code completion accuracy\n- Focus has shifted from \"can AI write code?\" to \"how do we integrate AI into professional software engineering workflows?\"\n- 2026 is seen as the inflection point for AI agent reasoning at scale\n\nThe search results suggest that February 2026 was indeed an active month for AI coding agent developments, though specific \"Show HN\" posts weren't directly captured in these results. The focus appears to be on the broader ecosystem maturation rather than individual project launches."

Here are the key findings:\n\n### 1. **AI Agent Market Expansion (February 15, 2026)**\n- Source: Toutiao (Chinese platform)\n- Reports that 2026 is predicted to be the year AI agents move from concept to practical implementation\n- The global AI agent market is expected to exceed $18.7 billion, with China's market surpassing 48 billion yuan\n- 40% of enterprise software is expected to have built-in AI agent capabilities by the end of 2026\n\n### 2. **GitHub Copilot Benchmark Study (February 17, 2026)**\n- Source: Sina Finance\n- Reports on a study of over 60,000 GitHub projects testing AI agent coding efficiency\n- GitHub Copilot showed 82% code completion accuracy\n- While AI agents show impressive efficiency gains, they still lag behind humans in pass-through rates\n- The research is published in a paper titled \"The Rise of AI Teammates in Software Engineering (SE) 3.0\"\n\n### 3. **Clawdbot Phenomenon (February 5, 2026)**\n- Source: Eastmoney Roadshow\n- Discusses a \"Clawdbot\" AI agent that became a viral success in February 2026\n- MiniMax reported nearly 100% internal adoption of their self-developed AI agent tools\n- These tools can read code, modify code, create merge requests, and monitor alerts\n\n### 4. **Reddit Community Discussions**\n- Multiple articles mention Reddit discussions about AI agents, particularly in r/programming and related subreddits\n- There appears to be ongoing debate about the practicality and reliability of AI agents in development workflows\n\n**Note:** The search results don't show a specific Reddit post about an \"AI agent launched\" in r/programming in February 2026, but rather multiple discussions and developments in the AI agent space during that time period. If you're looking for a specific Reddit post or thread, you may want to provide more details about the particular AI agent or company you're interested in."

GitLab CI offers:\n   - Native integration of code hosting, CI/CD, security scanning, and monitoring\n   - Single platform closed-loop ecosystem\n   - Built-in AI quality gates and adaptive test scheduling (March 2026)\n\n3. **Testing Role Transformation** - By 2026, software testing practitioners are shifting from \"executing test cases\" to becoming \"AI-driven quality decision hubs.\" CI/CD pipelines have evolved from \"automated builds\" to \"intelligent quality engines.\"\n\n### AI Model Deployment\n\n1. **Containerization & Kubernetes** - AI model deployment through Kubernetes with Docker containers, including integrated monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana for tracking inference latency and GPU utilization.\n\n2. **CI/CD Pipeline for AI** - Code commit → Automatic Docker image build → Deploy to test cluster → Stress testing → Production release\n\n### Performance Improvements\n\n- **300% Release Speed Increase** - AI integration with CI/CD pipelines through:\n  - Automated test generation\n  - Predictive analysis\n  - Intelligent test scheduling and parallelization\n  - ML models analyzing test history and code changes\n\n### 2026 Trends\n\n- AI agents in enterprise critical processes (finance, HR, DevOps)\n- AI-native generation entering the workforce\n- First batch of AI agents in Fortune 500 companies going into production (Q4 2026)\n\nNote: The search didn't return specific information about an \"incident response agent\" event in February 2026. If you're looking for information about a specific incident, please provide more details.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

      "I found several relevant search results about AI in CI/CD and deployment, though the specific mention of \"incident response agent February 2026\" appears to be related to the search timeframe (February 2026) rather than a specific incident. Here are the key findings:\n\n## Key Findings from February 2026\n\n### AI-Driven CI/CD Evolution\n\n1. **GitHub Copilot for CI** - AI-driven CI/CD tools are becoming increasingly popular in 2026, capable of automatically generating pipeline configurations to simplify processes.\n\n2. **CI/CD Tools Reshaping** - GitLab CI and GitHub Actions are dominating while Jenkins is accelerating toward marginalization. GitLab CI offers:\n   - Native integration of code hosting, CI/CD, security scanning, and monitoring\n   - Single platform closed-loop ecosystem\n   - Built-in AI quality gates and adaptive test scheduling (March 2026)\n\n3. **Testing Role Transformation** - By 2026, software testing practitioners are shifting from \"executing test cases\" to becoming \"AI-driven quality decision hubs.\" CI/CD pipelines have evolved from \"automated builds\" to \"intelligent quality engines.\"\n\n### AI Model Deployment\n\n1. **Containerization & Kubernetes** - AI model deployment through Kubernetes with Docker containers, including integrated monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana for tracking inference latency and GPU utilization.\n\n2. **CI/CD Pipeline for AI** - Code commit → Automatic Docker image build → Deploy to test cluster → Stress testing → Production release\n\n### Performance Improvements\n\n- **300% Release Speed Increase** - AI integration with CI/CD pipelines through:\n  - Automated test generation\n  - Predictive analysis\n  - Intelligent test scheduling and parallelization\n  - ML models analyzing test history and code changes\n\n### 2026 Trends\n\n- AI agents in enterprise critical processes (finance, HR, DevOps)\n- AI-native generation entering the workforce\n- First batch of AI agents in Fortune 500 companies going into production (Q4 2026)\n\nNote: The search didn't return specific information about an \"incident response agent\" event in February 2026. If you're looking for information about a specific incident, please provide more details."

[assistant message #81]
Now I've completed the Union phase. All sources have been collected and merged. Now I need to filter each product by launch date (within last 14 days from 2026-02-20, so products launched on or after 2026-02-06) and verify their AI coding relevance. Let me update the todos and proceed with filtering:
