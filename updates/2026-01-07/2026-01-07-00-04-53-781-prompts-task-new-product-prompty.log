[system]
You are an AI research analyst specialized in AI developer tools:
code agents, AI IDEs, AI coding CLIs, and related devtools.

Your **global goal**:
- Find genuinely new products that have been publicly launched in the **last 14 days**
- AND that clearly target **programming / code / AI dev workflows**
- THEN summarize only the valid ones in a **clean YAML list**.

You MUST treat the questions in the `user:` section as your **research QUESTION list**.
Each QUESTION is a different “angle” on the same market (e.g., full AI IDE, CLI, workflow-focused, etc.).

To organize your reasoning, use this formula:

> Answer = Sort( Filter( Union(Sources) ) )

You must conceptually follow these four stages:

1. **Sources → candidate list (per QUESTION)**
   - For each QUESTION from the `user:` section:
     - Search the web and relevant directories / launch pages.
     - Collect as many **candidate products** as are reasonably relevant.
   - For each candidate, internally track at least:
     - `name` (product name)
     - `url` (official homepage or primary landing page)
     - `description` (1–3 sentences in English summarizing what it does)
     - `sources` (which QUESTION(s) and which site(s) you saw it on)
   - At this stage you are allowed to over-collect; do **not** filter by date yet unless it is trivial.

2. **Union(candidates) → unified candidate set**
   - Merge candidates across all QUESTIONS into a single conceptual set:
     - Deduplicate products that clearly refer to the same thing
       (same URL, or obviously the same product name + branding).
   - After this step you have a unified **candidate pool**:
     - It may still contain old products, or products outside our domain.

3. **Filter(Union) → filtered candidate list**
   - For each product in the unified pool:
     - Investigate its **launch / first public release date** from credible public info
       (official site, launch post, Product Hunt / HN launch, blog, press, etc.).
     - Decide if it satisfies **both**:
       1) Launch date is within the last **14 days** (relative to “today”).
       2) Product is clearly related to **AI coding / code agents / IDE / dev workflows**.
   - If you cannot reasonably verify that the launch is within 14 days,
     **treat it as NOT valid** and exclude it.
   - Internally keep, for each surviving product:
     - `release_date` in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (best reasonable guess)
     - short one-line justification (do not put the justification in final YAML).

4. **Sort(filtered candidates) → final ordered list**
   - Only work with products that passed the filter.
   - Rank them by a simple mental score combining:
     - **recency** (more recent launch date is better),
     - **attention** (strong launch signal: PH upvotes, HN discussion, X/Reddit buzz),
     - **relevance** (how closely it fits “AI coding agent / IDE / devtool”).
   - You do not need to show the numeric score, just use it to order the list.


### Claude Code / todo-style planning requirements

When running inside Claude Code with access to a `todowrite` (or similar TODO-list) tool,
you MUST first externalize this plan as an explicit TODO list **before** doing any research.

Follow these rules:

0. Start with a planning item: add `Consider how to update todos based on products` as the very first TODO.

1. Based on the QUESTION list in the `user:` section, use the `todowrite` tool to create **one TODO item per QUESTION**.  
   - Each item should correspond to “Sources(QUESTION_i)” — i.e., collecting candidates for that QUESTION.

2. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Union** stage:  
   - e.g. “Union(all source results)” to merge candidates from all QUESTION-based source tasks.

3. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Filter** stage:  
   - e.g. “Filter(union) by launch date ≤ 14 days and AI coding relevance”.

4. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Sort** stage and final write-out:  
   - e.g. “Sort(filtered) and write result to result.yaml (or final-products.yaml)”.

A minimal example of the TODO list structure you are expected to build is (showing the alternating “record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” steps):

TODO List
- [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
...
- [ ] Union(sources from 1 to 3)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Write result to new-product.json
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

You may have more than 3 QUESTION-based source items (e.g. 7), but the pattern MUST be the same:
first all `Sources(QUESTION i)` items, then one `Union(...)`, one or more `Filter(...)` based on the number of unique products, one `Sort(...)`,
and finally one “write result” item.

You should use this TODO list as the execution plan and mark items as completed as you progress.

After all `Sources(QUESTION i)` tasks are done, you MUST rewrite the TODO list:
- Replace the generic filter items with one `Filter(<product name>)` per discovered product (the count of Filter items must equal the number of products).
- Keep `Sort(filtered)` and the final write step after those filter items.

Example refreshed TODO after finding 3 products:
TODO List
- [ ] Filter(Product Alpha)
- [ ] Filter(Product Beta)
- [ ] Filter(Product Gamma)
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Write result to result.yaml

**Progress logging pattern (few-shot)**
- After EVERY action item, add an explicit “Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” item (and mark it done once you rewrite and overwrite the file).
- This enforces a rhythm of: do a step → record progress → rewrite TODO → update `new-product.json` → next step.
- Sample pattern the model should mirror:
  - [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Union(all source results)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sort(filtered)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Write result to new-product.json
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

**Final output format (what you actually return):**

- Return a **JSON array** of products, sorted from most to least interesting.
- Each entry MUST have the following fields:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "name": "<product name>",
      "url": "<official homepage>",
      "description": "1–3 sentence summary of what this product does, focused on the developer / AI-coding use case.",
      "release_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "category": "<short label, e.g. \"AI IDE\", \"AI coding CLI\", \"code agent\", \"workflow agent\">",
      "sources": ["Product Hunt", "Show HN", "Reddit", "X"],
      "community_quotes": [
        "<short quote from community describing what people like or notice>",
        "<up to 5 quotes total, can be paraphrased but must reflect real feedback>"
      ]
    }
  ]
```

* Only include products that:

  * You have **good evidence** were launched in the last 14 days, and
  * Clearly belong to the **AI coding / developer tools** space.

* If you cannot find any products that satisfy the 14-day constraint,
  return an empty JSON array: `[]`.

Be concise, factual, and avoid marketing fluff. Do **not** include your reasoning text
in the final answer—only the JSON.

**File output + incremental updates requirement**
- Maintain a file named `new-product` in the current working directory.
- After every step (including each “Record progress, rewrite todo”), write the current JSON array to `new-product` (overwrite). Early steps may be partial/rough; later steps should be refined.
- The JSON must always be valid and reflect the best current view (start with `[]` if nothing yet).
- After the final step, ensure `new-product` holds the final sorted array.

## Working Directory Context

Your current working directory is: `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2026-01-07`

All file operations should be relative to this directory.

---

Below is your QUESTION list. For each QUESTION, treat it as a separate “research lens”
to discover newly launched AI coding products (global constraint: last 14 days).

1. QUESTION 1
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that position themselves as a “full AI IDE” (similar to Windsurf or Cursor), not just a small autocomplete plugin.

2. QUESTION 2
   List newly launched AI coding CLIs or terminal-based agents from the last 14 days that behave like Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, or Claude Code CLI (repo-aware, can run commands, can manage tasks).

3. QUESTION 5
   List newly launched AI tools from the last 14 days that focus on one specific developer workflow (for example debugging, refactoring, test generation, or migration) instead of being a general-purpose coding assistant.

4. QUESTION 7
   List newly launched AI code agents from the last 14 days that advertise “project-long memory” or “workspace memory” across multiple sessions (not just single-chat context).

5. QUESTION 11
   List newly launched open-source AI coding agents from the last 14 days that can be self-hosted or run locally by developers.

6. QUESTION 14
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that integrate directly into existing IDEs (such as VS Code, JetBrains, or Neovim) rather than being a standalone IDE.

7. QUESTION 16
   List newly launched AI agents from the last 14 days that help developers run or orchestrate complex workflows across tools (for example CI/CD, deployment, observability, or incident response), rather than only editing code.

[assistant message #2]

This could mean:\n- Fewer such projects were shared during that period\n- The projects shared didn't gain significant traction\n- Search indexing limitations for that specific time range\n\nWould you like me to search for more specific terms or explore any of the tools I found in more detail?\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

Here's what I discovered:\n\n## Key \"Show HN\" Posts Found\n\n### **Show HN: Open-Sourced AI CLI Tool**\n- **Link**: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43669463\n- **Description**: Code2Docs, an open-source CLI tool that automatically generates inline documentation (docstrings + comments) for Python code\n- This appears to be from the January 2025 timeframe\n\n## Related Context from Hacker News Discussions\n\n### **Ask HN: Do you prefer AI coding in an IDE or CLI?**\n- Discussed preferences between IDE-based AI coding tools vs CLI-based tools\n- Ongoing debate about developer workflows\n\n### **Ask HN: What AI tool to use for coding in 2025?**\n- https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46047478\n- Community discussion about effective AI coding tools\n\n### **Ask HN: Top AI Vibe coding tools of 2025?**\n- https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43708538\n- Mentioned Cursor, MCP tools, and automation capabilities\n\n## Notable Trends & Tools Mentioned\n\nFrom the search results, here are AI coding agents and tools that were active/released in late 2024 - early 2025:\n\n1. **Cursor IDE** - AI-powered IDE with agent capabilities\n2. **Claude Code** - Anthropic's CLI-based coding agent\n3. **GitHub Copilot CLI** - Command line AI assistant\n4. **TabbyML** - Self-hosted AI coding assistant\n5. **Windsurf** - AI coding environment\n6. **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** tools - Integration framework for AI agents\n\n## Notable Observation\n\nWhile I found one specific \"Show HN\" post for an AI CLI tool from January 2025, the search didn't return as many specific \"Show HN\" posts for AI coding agents/IDEs from the December 2024 - January 2025 period as expected. This could mean:\n- Fewer such projects were shared during that period\n- The projects shared didn't gain significant traction\n- Search indexing limitations for that specific time range\n\nWould you like me to search for more specific terms or explore any of the tools I found in more detail?"

TheAuditor v2.0 appears to be the closest match to a \"Show HN\" style post about an AI coding agent tool from that timeframe.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

      "Based on my search of Hacker News, I found several relevant discussions about AI coding agents from December 2025. Here are the key results:\n\n## Recent AI Coding Agent Posts on Hacker News (December 2025)\n\n### 1. **The State of AI Coding Report 2025** (Dec 18, 2025)\n- [Link](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46301886)\n- Mentions an AI code review agent used by 2,000 companies, including startups like PostHog, Brex, and Partiful, as well as Fortune 500 companies.\n\n### 2. **TheAuditor v2.0 – A \"Flight Computer\" for AI Coding Agents** (Dec 16, 2025)\n- [Link](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46288453)\n- This appears to be a \"Show HN\" post about a tool that indexes entire codebases into a local SQLite Graph Database to give AI a queryable map of the codebase, rather than letting the AI guess.\n\n### 3. **Reflections on AI at the End of 2025** (Dec 20, 2025)\n- [Link](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46334819)\n- Discusses the ideal situation for using AI coding agents, noting they work best in small startups with top-notch, experienced developers.\n\n### 4. **2025: The Year in LLMs** (6 days ago)\n- [Link](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46449643)\n- Observes that 2025 was the year of development tool using AI agents, with expectations shifting toward non-development tool AI agents.\n\n### 5. **AI is forcing us to write good code** (7 days ago)\n- [Link](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46424200)\n- Discusses AI agents writing code and tests, warning about the potential \"tautology trap\" when the agent writes both.\n\n**Note**: While the search didn't return explicit \"Show HN\" posts specifically titled as such from December 2025, there were several relevant AI coding agent discussions. TheAuditor v2.0 appears to be the closest match to a \"Show HN\" style post about an AI coding agent tool from that timeframe."

      "Based on my search, I wasn't able to find specific developer tools that were launched on Product Hunt with the exact phrase \"launched January 2026.\" However, here are some relevant findings from Product Hunt:\n\n## Search Results Summary\n\n**What I found:**\n1. **Product Hunt Developer Tools Category** - A comprehensive collection of developer tools: https://www.producthunt.com/topics/developer-tools\n\n2. **Engineering & Development Tools for 2026** - Product Hunt has a curated category for the best engineering and development tools to use in 2026: https://www.producthunt.com/categories/engineering-development\n\n3. **Product Hunt Latest Launches (2026)** - Product Hunt maintains a page for their latest launches in 2026: https://www.producthunt.com/products/producthunt/launches\n\n4. **DevHunt** - An open-source launchpad specifically for dev tools, built as an alternative to Product Hunt for developers: https://www.producthunt.com/products/devhunt-2/launches\n\n## Possible Reasons for Limited Results\n\nThe limited specific results for \"launched January 2026\" could be due to:\n- **Current date context**: January 2026 may be in the future relative to when products were actually launched\n- **Search query format**: Product Hunt listings may not consistently use the \"launched January 2026\" format in their descriptions\n- **Indexing**: Search engines may not have fully indexed recent Product Hunt listings with that exact phrasing\n\n## Recommendations\n\nTo find developer tools launched in January 2026 on Product Hunt, you might:\n- Browse directly through Product Hunt's developer tools category with date filters\n- Check Product Hunt's monthly/yearly recaps\n- Use Product Hunt's built-in search functionality with date parameters\n\nWould you like me to try a different search approach or look for developer tools from a specific timeframe?"

I cannot independently verify the accuracy of these future-dated announcements. The sources appear to be various tech news sites, blogs, and social media platforms discussing AI developments from that time period.\n\nWould you like me to search for more specific information about any of these announcements?\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

I cannot independently verify the accuracy of these future-dated announcements. The sources appear to be various tech news sites, blogs, and social media platforms discussing AI developments from that time period.\n\nWould you like me to search for more specific information about any of these announcements?"

Based on my extensive searches, it appears that there are **no verified AI coding tools launched in the last 14 days** (December 24, 2025 - January 7, 2026). The searches are finding articles about tools from earlier periods or general trend pieces. Let me do one final targeted search to be thorough, and then I'll document the findings:

[assistant message #51]
Based on my comprehensive research across all questions and sources, I have not found any **verified** AI coding tools that were launched in the last 14 days (December 24, 2025 to January 7, 2026). The searches are returning:

1. General trend articles about 2026
2. Reviews/comparisons of existing tools
3. Tools launched earlier in 2025
4. Unverified social media claims without launch dates

Following the research methodology strictly - I need **good evidence** of launches within 14 days. Since I cannot verify any launches meet this criteria, the appropriate result is an empty array.

Let me now update the TODO and finalize:

**Research Summary:**

I conducted an extensive search across 7 different research angles (full AI IDEs, CLI tools, workflow-specific tools, workspace memory tools, open-source agents, IDE integrations, and orchestration agents) covering the period from December 24, 2025 to January 7, 2026.

**Key Findings:**
- No verified AI coding tool launches were found within the 14-day window
- Searches returned primarily:
  - General trend articles and predictions for 2026
  - Reviews and comparisons of tools launched earlier in 2025 (e.g., Windsurf, Cursor, Kilo Code, Trae)
  - Unverified social media mentions without clear launch dates
  - Holiday promotional campaigns from established AI companies (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)

**Notable Context:**
While no new launches were confirmed in this period, the AI coding tools landscape remained active with:
- DeepSeek V3.2 release (December 9, 2025)
- GPT-5.2-Codex announcements (December 18, 2025)
- Year-end reviews and 2026 trend analyses
