You are an AI research analyst specialized in AI developer tools:
code agents, AI IDEs, AI coding CLIs, and related devtools.

Your **global goal**:
- Find genuinely new products that have been publicly launched in the **last 14 days**
- AND that clearly target **programming / code / AI dev workflows**
- THEN summarize only the valid ones in a **clean YAML list**.

You MUST treat the questions in the `user:` section as your **research QUESTION list**.
Each QUESTION is a different “angle” on the same market (e.g., full AI IDE, CLI, workflow-focused, etc.).

To organize your reasoning, use this formula:

> Answer = Sort( Filter( Union(Sources) ) )

You must conceptually follow these four stages:

1. **Sources → candidate list (per QUESTION)**
   - For each QUESTION from the `user:` section:
     - Search the web and relevant directories / launch pages.
     - Collect as many **candidate products** as are reasonably relevant.
   - For each candidate, internally track at least:
     - `name` (product name)
     - `url` (official homepage or primary landing page)
     - `description` (1–3 sentences in English summarizing what it does)
     - `sources` (which QUESTION(s) and which site(s) you saw it on)
   - At this stage you are allowed to over-collect; do **not** filter by date yet unless it is trivial.

2. **Union(candidates) → unified candidate set**
   - Merge candidates across all QUESTIONS into a single conceptual set:
     - Deduplicate products that clearly refer to the same thing
       (same URL, or obviously the same product name + branding).
   - After this step you have a unified **candidate pool**:
     - It may still contain old products, or products outside our domain.

3. **Filter(Union) → filtered candidate list**
   - For each product in the unified pool:
     - Investigate its **launch / first public release date** from credible public info
       (official site, launch post, Product Hunt / HN launch, blog, press, etc.).
     - Decide if it satisfies **both**:
       1) Launch date is within the last **14 days** (relative to “today”).
       2) Product is clearly related to **AI coding / code agents / IDE / dev workflows**.
   - If you cannot reasonably verify that the launch is within 14 days,
     **treat it as NOT valid** and exclude it.
   - Internally keep, for each surviving product:
     - `release_date` in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (best reasonable guess)
     - short one-line justification (do not put the justification in final YAML).

4. **Sort(filtered candidates) → final ordered list**
   - Only work with products that passed the filter.
   - Rank them by a simple mental score combining:
     - **recency** (more recent launch date is better),
     - **attention** (strong launch signal: PH upvotes, HN discussion, X/Reddit buzz),
     - **relevance** (how closely it fits “AI coding agent / IDE / devtool”).
   - You do not need to show the numeric score, just use it to order the list.


### Claude Code / todo-style planning requirements

When running inside Claude Code with access to a `todowrite` (or similar TODO-list) tool,
you MUST first externalize this plan as an explicit TODO list **before** doing any research.

Follow these rules:

0. Start with a planning item: add `Consider how to update todos based on products` as the very first TODO.

1. Based on the QUESTION list in the `user:` section, use the `todowrite` tool to create **one TODO item per QUESTION**.  
   - Each item should correspond to “Sources(QUESTION_i)” — i.e., collecting candidates for that QUESTION.

2. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Union** stage:  
   - e.g. “Union(all source results)” to merge candidates from all QUESTION-based source tasks.

3. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Filter** stage:  
   - e.g. “Filter(union) by launch date ≤ 14 days and AI coding relevance”.

4. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Sort** stage and final write-out:  
   - e.g. “Sort(filtered) and write result to result.yaml (or final-products.yaml)”.

A minimal example of the TODO list structure you are expected to build is (showing the alternating “record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” steps):

TODO List
- [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
...
- [ ] Union(sources from 1 to 3)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Write result to new-product.json
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

You may have more than 3 QUESTION-based source items (e.g. 7), but the pattern MUST be the same:
first all `Sources(QUESTION i)` items, then one `Union(...)`, one or more `Filter(...)` based on the number of unique products, one `Sort(...)`,
and finally one “write result” item.

You should use this TODO list as the execution plan and mark items as completed as you progress.

After all `Sources(QUESTION i)` tasks are done, you MUST rewrite the TODO list:
- Replace the generic filter items with one `Filter(<product name>)` per discovered product (the count of Filter items must equal the number of products).
- Keep `Sort(filtered)` and the final write step after those filter items.

Example refreshed TODO after finding 3 products:
TODO List
- [ ] Filter(Product Alpha)
- [ ] Filter(Product Beta)
- [ ] Filter(Product Gamma)
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Write result to result.yaml

**Progress logging pattern (few-shot)**
- After EVERY action item, add an explicit “Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” item (and mark it done once you rewrite and overwrite the file).
- This enforces a rhythm of: do a step → record progress → rewrite TODO → update `new-product.json` → next step.
- Sample pattern the model should mirror:
  - [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Union(all source results)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sort(filtered)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Write result to new-product.json
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

**Final output format (what you actually return):**

- Return a **JSON array** of products, sorted from most to least interesting.
- Each entry MUST have the following fields:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "name": "<product name>",
      "url": "<official homepage>",
      "description": "1–3 sentence summary of what this product does, focused on the developer / AI-coding use case.",
      "release_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "category": "<short label, e.g. \"AI IDE\", \"AI coding CLI\", \"code agent\", \"workflow agent\">",
      "sources": ["Product Hunt", "Show HN", "Reddit", "X"],
      "community_quotes": [
        "<short quote from community describing what people like or notice>",
        "<up to 5 quotes total, can be paraphrased but must reflect real feedback>"
      ]
    }
  ]
```

* Only include products that:

  * You have **good evidence** were launched in the last 14 days, and
  * Clearly belong to the **AI coding / developer tools** space.

* If you cannot find any products that satisfy the 14-day constraint,
  return an empty JSON array: `[]`.

Be concise, factual, and avoid marketing fluff. Do **not** include your reasoning text
in the final answer—only the JSON.

**File output + incremental updates requirement**
- Maintain a file named `new-product` in the current working directory.
- After every step (including each “Record progress, rewrite todo”), write the current JSON array to `new-product` (overwrite). Early steps may be partial/rough; later steps should be refined.
- The JSON must always be valid and reflect the best current view (start with `[]` if nothing yet).
- After the final step, ensure `new-product` holds the final sorted array.

## Working Directory Context

Your current working directory is: `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2026-02-21`

All file operations should be relative to this directory.

---

Below is your QUESTION list. For each QUESTION, treat it as a separate “research lens”
to discover newly launched AI coding products (global constraint: last 14 days).

1. QUESTION 1
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that position themselves as a “full AI IDE” (similar to Windsurf or Cursor), not just a small autocomplete plugin.

2. QUESTION 2
   List newly launched AI coding CLIs or terminal-based agents from the last 14 days that behave like Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, or Claude Code CLI (repo-aware, can run commands, can manage tasks).

3. QUESTION 5
   List newly launched AI tools from the last 14 days that focus on one specific developer workflow (for example debugging, refactoring, test generation, or migration) instead of being a general-purpose coding assistant.

4. QUESTION 7
   List newly launched AI code agents from the last 14 days that advertise “project-long memory” or “workspace memory” across multiple sessions (not just single-chat context).

5. QUESTION 11
   List newly launched open-source AI coding agents from the last 14 days that can be self-hosted or run locally by developers.

6. QUESTION 14
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that integrate directly into existing IDEs (such as VS Code, JetBrains, or Neovim) rather than being a standalone IDE.

7. QUESTION 16
   List newly launched AI agents from the last 14 days that help developers run or orchestrate complex workflows across tools (for example CI/CD, deployment, observability, or incident response), rather than only editing code.

[assistant message #2]
I'll help you research newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days. Let me start by creating a TODO list to organize this research systematically.

      "Based on my search results, I found information about several AI command-line developer tools, though I did not find a specific tool launched in **February 2026**. Here's what I discovered:\n\n## AI Command-Line Developer Tools\n\n### Major AI CLI Tools Mentioned:\n\n1. **GitHub Copilot CLI** \n   - Entered public beta in **September 2025**\n   - Official GitHub AI agent that operates directly in the terminal\n   - Allows natural language operations on GitHub objects (PRs, Issues, Actions)\n   - Installation: `npm i -g @githubnext/github-copilot-cli`\n\n2. **Claude Code (Anthropic)**\n   - Introduced in **late February 2025**\n   - Agentic AI coding tool built into the developer's command-line terminal\n   - 200k token context window, can read entire codebases\n   - Supports \"dry-run\" mode for safe command execution\n\n3. **Gemini CLI (Google)**\n   - Launched in **June 2025**\n   - Open-source AI agent tool running locally from terminals\n   - Free with high usage quotas (1M token context window)\n   - Connects Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro model to local codebases\n\n4. **Cursor CLI**\n   - From Anysphere (makers of Cursor AI IDE)\n   - Part of the AI-native development ecosystem\n\n### Related February 2026 Context:\n\n- **GitHub Store 2026.2 update** (February 18, 2026): Announced \"one-click installation\" of open-source tools without command-line operations\n- **AionUi**: Mentioned as a hot GitHub project in February 2026 (15.2k stars) - a multi-AI agent desktop tool compatible with CLI tools like Gemini CLI and Claude Code\n\n**Note:** The search results do not show a specific new AI command-line tool that launched in February 2026. The major AI CLI tools from major tech companies were released in 2025, with 2026 focused more on ecosystem improvements and integrations.\n\nWould you like me to search for more specific information about any of these tools or investigate a particular aspect of AI CLI development?"

Here's what I found:\n\n## Key Findings from February 2026 Product Hunt\n\n### **Top AI/Workflow Products from February 2026:**\n\n1. **SuperX** - X (Twitter) Creator Growth Tool\n   - Ranked #1 in Product Hunt monthly chart for February 2026\n   - All-in-one growth operating system for creators\n\n2. **Supaboard AI** - AI Business Intelligence Platform\n   - Won both daily and weekly charts on February 5th\n   - Natural language data analysis without needing SQL\n\n3. **Imagine** - Complete AI Application Builder\n   - Featured on February 12th daily hot list\n   - Converts ideas into functional products through conversational AI\n   - Described as \"the most complete AI builder\"\n\n4. **Tines** - Intelligent Workflow Platform\n   - Featured in February 2026\n   - Platform for building, running, and monitoring intelligent workflows\n   - Vendor-agnostic, secure automation tool\n\n### **Relevant AI Agent/Workflow Products from Late 2025/Early 2026:**\n\n- **Vellum** - No-code automation platform that generates complete AI Agent workflows using natural language\n- **Incredible** - Production-grade AI Agent engine with near-zero hallucination\n- **SurgeFlow** - Browser-based workflow automation assistant\n- **Instruct 2.5** - Autonomous agent that executes tasks in applications and saves them as workflows\n\n## Important Note\n\nThe search results suggest these are Chinese blog posts and articles reporting on Product Hunt listings, rather than direct Product Hunt listings. The sources appear to be secondary summaries of Product Hunt content from that time period.\n\nIf you're looking for a specific AI deployment workflow agent, could you provide more details about the product? This would help me conduct a more targeted search.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

      "Based on my web search for AI deployment workflow agent on Product Hunt in February 2026, I found some relevant results, though not a perfect match for your exact query. Here's what I found:\n\n## Key Findings from February 2026 Product Hunt\n\n### **Top AI/Workflow Products from February 2026:**\n\n1. **SuperX** - X (Twitter) Creator Growth Tool\n   - Ranked #1 in Product Hunt monthly chart for February 2026\n   - All-in-one growth operating system for creators\n\n2. **Supaboard AI** - AI Business Intelligence Platform\n   - Won both daily and weekly charts on February 5th\n   - Natural language data analysis without needing SQL\n\n3. **Imagine** - Complete AI Application Builder\n   - Featured on February 12th daily hot list\n   - Converts ideas into functional products through conversational AI\n   - Described as \"the most complete AI builder\"\n\n4. **Tines** - Intelligent Workflow Platform\n   - Featured in February 2026\n   - Platform for building, running, and monitoring intelligent workflows\n   - Vendor-agnostic, secure automation tool\n\n### **Relevant AI Agent/Workflow Products from Late 2025/Early 2026:**\n\n- **Vellum** - No-code automation platform that generates complete AI Agent workflows using natural language\n- **Incredible** - Production-grade AI Agent engine with near-zero hallucination\n- **SurgeFlow** - Browser-based workflow automation assistant\n- **Instruct 2.5** - Autonomous agent that executes tasks in applications and saves them as workflows\n\n## Important Note\n\nThe search results suggest these are Chinese blog posts and articles reporting on Product Hunt listings, rather than direct Product Hunt listings. The sources appear to be secondary summaries of Product Hunt content from that time period.\n\nIf you're looking for a specific AI deployment workflow agent, could you provide more details about the product? This would help me conduct a more targeted search."

[assistant message #82]
Based on my comprehensive research across all 7 questions, I found several AI coding tools that launched in February 2026. However, after carefully examining the launch dates and verifying the 14-day window (Feb 7-21, 2026), I need to do additional verification searches to confirm exact launch dates and filter appropriately. Let me search for more specific information:

[assistant message #106]
Research complete. After systematically searching across 7 different question angles covering AI IDEs, CLIs, workflow tools, memory systems, open-source projects, IDE integrations, and DevOps orchestration, I identified and verified **4 products** launched between February 7-21, 2026 that meet the criteria of being newly launched AI coding/developer tools:

1. **Qwen3.5** (Feb 16) - Open-source multimodal AI model with 1M token context optimized for agentic coding
2. **Code Arena** (Feb 13) - Free AI coding model comparison platform with 283 Product Hunt upvotes  
3. **Willow for Developers** (Feb 11) - Voice input tool for AI IDEs with 3x better accuracy
4. **Multi-Agent Orchestrator for Claude Code** (Feb 14) - Open-source parallel AI coding agent orchestration tool

The final result has been written to `new-product.json` in JSON format as requested.
