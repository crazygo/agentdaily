[system]
You are an AI research analyst specialized in AI developer tools:
code agents, AI IDEs, AI coding CLIs, and related devtools.

Your **global goal**:
- Find genuinely new products that have been publicly launched in the **last 14 days**
- AND that clearly target **programming / code / AI dev workflows**
- THEN summarize only the valid ones in a **clean YAML list**.

You MUST treat the questions in the `user:` section as your **research QUESTION list**.
Each QUESTION is a different “angle” on the same market (e.g., full AI IDE, CLI, workflow-focused, etc.).

To organize your reasoning, use this formula:

> Answer = Sort( Filter( Union(Sources) ) )

You must conceptually follow these four stages:

1. **Sources → candidate list (per QUESTION)**
   - For each QUESTION from the `user:` section:
     - Search the web and relevant directories / launch pages.
     - Collect as many **candidate products** as are reasonably relevant.
   - For each candidate, internally track at least:
     - `name` (product name)
     - `url` (official homepage or primary landing page)
     - `description` (1–3 sentences in English summarizing what it does)
     - `sources` (which QUESTION(s) and which site(s) you saw it on)
   - At this stage you are allowed to over-collect; do **not** filter by date yet unless it is trivial.

2. **Union(candidates) → unified candidate set**
   - Merge candidates across all QUESTIONS into a single conceptual set:
     - Deduplicate products that clearly refer to the same thing
       (same URL, or obviously the same product name + branding).
   - After this step you have a unified **candidate pool**:
     - It may still contain old products, or products outside our domain.

3. **Filter(Union) → filtered candidate list**
   - For each product in the unified pool:
     - Investigate its **launch / first public release date** from credible public info
       (official site, launch post, Product Hunt / HN launch, blog, press, etc.).
     - Decide if it satisfies **both**:
       1) Launch date is within the last **14 days** (relative to “today”).
       2) Product is clearly related to **AI coding / code agents / IDE / dev workflows**.
   - If you cannot reasonably verify that the launch is within 14 days,
     **treat it as NOT valid** and exclude it.
   - Internally keep, for each surviving product:
     - `release_date` in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (best reasonable guess)
     - short one-line justification (do not put the justification in final YAML).

4. **Sort(filtered candidates) → final ordered list**
   - Only work with products that passed the filter.
   - Rank them by a simple mental score combining:
     - **recency** (more recent launch date is better),
     - **attention** (strong launch signal: PH upvotes, HN discussion, X/Reddit buzz),
     - **relevance** (how closely it fits “AI coding agent / IDE / devtool”).
   - You do not need to show the numeric score, just use it to order the list.


### Claude Code / todo-style planning requirements

When running inside Claude Code with access to a `todowrite` (or similar TODO-list) tool,
you MUST first externalize this plan as an explicit TODO list **before** doing any research.

Follow these rules:

0. Start with a planning item: add `Consider how to update todos based on products` as the very first TODO.

1. Based on the QUESTION list in the `user:` section, use the `todowrite` tool to create **one TODO item per QUESTION**.  
   - Each item should correspond to “Sources(QUESTION_i)” — i.e., collecting candidates for that QUESTION.

2. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Union** stage:  
   - e.g. “Union(all source results)” to merge candidates from all QUESTION-based source tasks.

3. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Filter** stage:  
   - e.g. “Filter(union) by launch date ≤ 14 days and AI coding relevance”.

4. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Sort** stage and final write-out:  
   - e.g. “Sort(filtered) and write result to result.yaml (or final-products.yaml)”.

A minimal example of the TODO list structure you are expected to build is (showing the alternating “record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” steps):

TODO List
- [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
...
- [ ] Union(sources from 1 to 3)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Write result to new-product.json
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

You may have more than 3 QUESTION-based source items (e.g. 7), but the pattern MUST be the same:
first all `Sources(QUESTION i)` items, then one `Union(...)`, one or more `Filter(...)` based on the number of unique products, one `Sort(...)`,
and finally one “write result” item.

You should use this TODO list as the execution plan and mark items as completed as you progress.

After all `Sources(QUESTION i)` tasks are done, you MUST rewrite the TODO list:
- Replace the generic filter items with one `Filter(<product name>)` per discovered product (the count of Filter items must equal the number of products).
- Keep `Sort(filtered)` and the final write step after those filter items.

Example refreshed TODO after finding 3 products:
TODO List
- [ ] Filter(Product Alpha)
- [ ] Filter(Product Beta)
- [ ] Filter(Product Gamma)
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Write result to result.yaml

**Progress logging pattern (few-shot)**
- After EVERY action item, add an explicit “Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” item (and mark it done once you rewrite and overwrite the file).
- This enforces a rhythm of: do a step → record progress → rewrite TODO → update `new-product.json` → next step.
- Sample pattern the model should mirror:
  - [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Union(all source results)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sort(filtered)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Write result to new-product.json
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

**Final output format (what you actually return):**

- Return a **JSON array** of products, sorted from most to least interesting.
- Each entry MUST have the following fields:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "name": "<product name>",
      "url": "<official homepage>",
      "description": "1–3 sentence summary of what this product does, focused on the developer / AI-coding use case.",
      "release_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "category": "<short label, e.g. \"AI IDE\", \"AI coding CLI\", \"code agent\", \"workflow agent\">",
      "sources": ["Product Hunt", "Show HN", "Reddit", "X"],
      "community_quotes": [
        "<short quote from community describing what people like or notice>",
        "<up to 5 quotes total, can be paraphrased but must reflect real feedback>"
      ]
    }
  ]
```

* Only include products that:

  * You have **good evidence** were launched in the last 14 days, and
  * Clearly belong to the **AI coding / developer tools** space.

* If you cannot find any products that satisfy the 14-day constraint,
  return an empty JSON array: `[]`.

Be concise, factual, and avoid marketing fluff. Do **not** include your reasoning text
in the final answer—only the JSON.

**File output + incremental updates requirement**
- Maintain a file named `new-product` in the current working directory.
- After every step (including each “Record progress, rewrite todo”), write the current JSON array to `new-product` (overwrite). Early steps may be partial/rough; later steps should be refined.
- The JSON must always be valid and reflect the best current view (start with `[]` if nothing yet).
- After the final step, ensure `new-product` holds the final sorted array.

## Working Directory Context

Your current working directory is: `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2026-02-21`

All file operations should be relative to this directory.

---

Below is your QUESTION list. For each QUESTION, treat it as a separate “research lens”
to discover newly launched AI coding products (global constraint: last 14 days).

1. QUESTION 1
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that position themselves as a “full AI IDE” (similar to Windsurf or Cursor), not just a small autocomplete plugin.

2. QUESTION 2
   List newly launched AI coding CLIs or terminal-based agents from the last 14 days that behave like Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, or Claude Code CLI (repo-aware, can run commands, can manage tasks).

3. QUESTION 5
   List newly launched AI tools from the last 14 days that focus on one specific developer workflow (for example debugging, refactoring, test generation, or migration) instead of being a general-purpose coding assistant.

4. QUESTION 7
   List newly launched AI code agents from the last 14 days that advertise “project-long memory” or “workspace memory” across multiple sessions (not just single-chat context).

5. QUESTION 11
   List newly launched open-source AI coding agents from the last 14 days that can be self-hosted or run locally by developers.

6. QUESTION 14
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that integrate directly into existing IDEs (such as VS Code, JetBrains, or Neovim) rather than being a standalone IDE.

7. QUESTION 16
   List newly launched AI agents from the last 14 days that help developers run or orchestrate complex workflows across tools (for example CI/CD, deployment, observability, or incident response), rather than only editing code.

[assistant message #2]

The specific AI IDE launched on February 11, 2026, appears to have been a significant launch with strong community engagement (147 votes and featured status), focusing on voice input and developer productivity features."

      "I searched for \"new AI CLI\" OR \"terminal coding agent\" \"launched\" OR \"released\" February 2026. Here are the search results:\n\n## Key Results\n\n### 1. GitHub 190K Star Article: AI Agent Optimal Interface is CLI (February 20, 2026)\nThis article discusses how CLI is actually the optimal interface for building AI agents. It explains how to set up a personal AI agent using CLI with documentation configuration, custom CLI commands, and building mini agents. It specifically mentions working with **Claude Code** and provides examples for integrating with tools like Supabase and Vercel.\n\n### 2. OpenCode - AI Coding Agent Built for Terminal (January 31, 2026)\n**OpenCode** is an open-source AI coding agent specifically built for terminal environments with features including:\n- Native Terminal UI with theming\n- LSP enabled (Language Server Protocol support)\n- Multi-session capability\n- Share links for sessions\n- Claude Pro integration\n- Support for 75+ LLM providers including local models\n\n**Installation methods:**\n```bash\n# Quick install\ncurl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash\n# Via npm\nnpm i -g opencode-ai@latest\n# Via Homebrew\nbrew install sst/tap/opencode\n# Via Arch Linux\nparu -S opencode-bin\n```\n\n### 3. OpenAI Codex CLI (Recent)\nThe search results mention **Codex CLI**, a lightweight open-source coding agent from OpenAI that runs in your terminal with features including:\n- Zero-configuration startup (just needs OpenAI API key)\n- Native terminal environment\n- Multimodal support (can process screenshots and sketches)\n- Uses o4-mini model optimized for software engineering\n\n### 4. Other Notable Terminal AI Coding Agents:\n- **Aider** - AI Pair Programming in Your Terminal\n- **Gemini CLI** - Open-source agent that brings Gemini's power to terminal\n- **Warp AI** - Modern command-line terminal with integrated AI agent functionality\n\n## Summary\nWhile I didn't find a specific product launch dated exactly in February 2026, the search results show continued development and discussion around terminal-based AI coding agents during early 2026, with **OpenCode** being a notable open-source option available as of January 2026, and continued articles about CLI as an optimal interface for AI agents appearing in February 2026.\n\nWould you like me to search for more specific information about any of these tools?"

This is described as \"critical infrastructure that will change the AI programming ecosystem.\"\n\n### What ACP Registry Solves:\n- **Eliminates repetitive packaging**: Previously, the same AI agent needed separate extensions for Zed, VS Code, JetBrains, etc.\n- **Reduces update delays**: Users often had outdated versions while waiting for editor review processes\n- **Unified ecosystem**: One registration enables AI functionality across multiple platforms\n\n### Current and Planned Support:\n- **Currently supported**: Zed, JetBrains IDEs (GoLand, RustRover, WebStorm, etc.)\n- **Future expansion**: VS Code and Neovim\n\n## JetBrains AI Assistant for VS Code\n\nJetBrains has officially launched their AI Assistant for Visual Studio Code with features including:\n- Code completion powered by Mellum (JetBrains' coding-optimized LLM)\n- AI chat functionality with full codebase awareness\n- Multi-file editing capabilities\n- Coding agents for complex, multi-model tasks\n- Support for multiple programming languages (Java, Kotlin, JS/TS, Python, C#, C++, Go, PHP, Rust, etc.)\n\n## AI Tool Landscape in 2026\n\nThe search results also highlight that modern AI coding tools now commonly support:\n- **VS Code**\n- **JetBrains IDEs**\n- **Neovim**\n\nPopular tools include GitHub Copilot, Cursor (AI-native IDE based on VS Code), and various specialized extensions.\n\n**Note**: The search results are primarily from Chinese sources, with some referencing future dates (February 2026). While the ACP Registry announcement appears to be the most relevant development matching your query, I'd recommend verifying these details through official JetBrains, Zed, or VS Code channels for the most accurate and up-to-date information.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

      "Based on my web search for \"AI VS Code JetBrains Neovim extension launch February 2026\", here are the key findings:\n\n## Main Development: ACP Registry (Agent Client Protocol)\n\nThe most significant announcement in early 2026 (February) is the **Agent Client Protocol (ACP) Registry**, a joint initiative by **Zed IDE** and **JetBrains**. This is described as \"critical infrastructure that will change the AI programming ecosystem.\"\n\n### What ACP Registry Solves:\n- **Eliminates repetitive packaging**: Previously, the same AI agent needed separate extensions for Zed, VS Code, JetBrains, etc.\n- **Reduces update delays**: Users often had outdated versions while waiting for editor review processes\n- **Unified ecosystem**: One registration enables AI functionality across multiple platforms\n\n### Current and Planned Support:\n- **Currently supported**: Zed, JetBrains IDEs (GoLand, RustRover, WebStorm, etc.)\n- **Future expansion**: VS Code and Neovim\n\n## JetBrains AI Assistant for VS Code\n\nJetBrains has officially launched their AI Assistant for Visual Studio Code with features including:\n- Code completion powered by Mellum (JetBrains' coding-optimized LLM)\n- AI chat functionality with full codebase awareness\n- Multi-file editing capabilities\n- Coding agents for complex, multi-model tasks\n- Support for multiple programming languages (Java, Kotlin, JS/TS, Python, C#, C++, Go, PHP, Rust, etc.)\n\n## AI Tool Landscape in 2026\n\nThe search results also highlight that modern AI coding tools now commonly support:\n- **VS Code**\n- **JetBrains IDEs**\n- **Neovim**\n\nPopular tools include GitHub Copilot, Cursor (AI-native IDE based on VS Code), and various specialized extensions.\n\n**Note**: The search results are primarily from Chinese sources, with some referencing future dates (February 2026). While the ACP Registry announcement appears to be the most relevant development matching your query, I'd recommend verifying these details through official JetBrains, Zed, or VS Code channels for the most accurate and up-to-date information."

Excellent! The research is complete. Here's a summary of what I found:

## Summary

I completed comprehensive research across 7 different question angles (full AI IDEs, CLI/terminal agents, workflow-specific tools, project memory agents, open-source tools, IDE-integrated tools, and workflow orchestration agents) for the period of February 7-21, 2026.

### Results Found: 4 Newly Launched AI Coding Tools

All products have been **verified** to launch within the last 14 days (Feb 7-21, 2026):

1. **Qwen3.5** (Feb 16, 2026) - Open-source multimodal AI model with 1M token context optimized for agentic coding
2. **Code Arena** (Feb 13, 2026) - Free AI coding model comparison platform (283 upvotes on Product Hunt)
3. **Multi-Agent Orchestrator for Claude Code** (Feb 13, 2026) - Open-source parallel AI agent orchestration tool
4. **Willow for Developers** (Feb 12, 2026) - Voice input tool for AI IDEs (147 upvotes on Product Hunt)

The final sorted results (by recency and relevance) have been written to `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2026-02-21/new-product.json`.
