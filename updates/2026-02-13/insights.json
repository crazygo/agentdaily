The study found AI introduced a new rhythm of managing multiple active threads simultaneously: manually writing code while AI generated alternatives, running parallel agents, or reviving deferred tasks. This created cognitive load and a sense of always juggling, even as work felt productive. Willison noted he frequently finds his mental energy depleted after just 1-2 hours despite getting 'so much done'.",
