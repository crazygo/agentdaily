    "title": "Vibe Coding: A New Kind of Programming",
    "description": "Andrej Karpathy coined the term 'vibe coding' to describe a new kind of programming using English language to build software with AI assistance. The concept gained significant traction throughout 2025, with Karpathy noting that '2025 is the year that AI crossed a capability threshold necessary to build all kinds of impressive programs simply via English.' He demonstrated this through projects like 'LLM Council' which became a blueprint for enterprise AI systems.",
