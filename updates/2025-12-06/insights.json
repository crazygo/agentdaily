    "description": "Unable to collect AI coding insights from thought leaders and sources due to web search and web reader API reaching monthly usage limits. Both tools return error code 1308 indicating usage cap will reset on January 1, 2026. This affects all planned data sources including: Andrej Karpathy (@karpathy), Simon Willison (simonwillison.net), Amjad Masad (@amasad), Lex Fridman Podcast, YouTube channels (Two Minute Papers, Fireship, AI Explained, 3Blue1Brown, Yannic Kilcher, The AI Epiphany), podcasts (The Changelog, Software Engineering Daily, NVIDIA AI Podcast, Stack Overflow Podcast, a16z Podcast), tech media (TechCrunch, The Verge, Wired, MIT Technology Review, Ars Technica, IEEE Spectrum), technical platforms (Papers with Code, ArXiv cs.AI/cs.LG, Towards Data Science), and community platforms (Hacker News, Reddit r/MachineLearning, r/artificial, r/programming). Previous insights from Simon Willison (Nov 28 Bluesky Thread Viewer, Nov 24 sqlite-utils 4.0a1) were found but fall outside the 7-day window. This highlights a critical limitation in automated research workflows that depend on third-party API services with usage quotas, suggesting the need for diversified data collection strategies or offline research capabilities.",
