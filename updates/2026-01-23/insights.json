    "description": "New research from Mercor introduces APEX-Agents benchmark testing AI models on real white-collar work tasks from consulting, investment banking, and law. Most models failed, with even the best (Gemini 3 Flash at 24%, GPT-5.2 at 23%) struggling to get more than a quarter of questions right. The biggest challenge was tracking information across multiple domains and tools like Slack and Google Drive, which is integral to real knowledge work.",

    "description": "Anthropic's performance optimization team has had to repeatedly redesign their technical take-home test for job applicants as each new Claude model improves. Claude Opus 4 outperformed most human applicants, then Opus 4.5 matched even the strongest candidates. The team had to create a novel test that stumps contemporary AI tools to distinguish top human talent from AI output. The original test was shared publicly with a challenge: 'If you can best Opus 4.5, we'd love to hear from you.'",

    "description": "A growing trend of people with no tech background building their own apps for personal use due to AI advancements. These 'micro apps', 'personal apps', or 'fleeting apps' are intended for creator-only use and temporary duration. Examples include a dining recommendation app built in 7 days using Claude and ChatGPT, a podcast translation app, a vice tracker, and a parking ticket payment automator. Tools like Claude Code, Replit, Bolt, and Lovable are enabling this shift. Mobile micro apps are emerging through startups like Anything ($11M raised) and VibeCode ($9.4M raised).",

Tools like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Lovable, and Replit enable even people with little coding knowledge to build apps. 'Vibe coding' is emerging where practitioners let software take the lead. However, AI hallucinations remain a concern, and we're seeing early effects including fewer entry-level jobs for younger workers. AI tools also struggle with large, complex codebases.",
