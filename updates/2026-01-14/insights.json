    "description": "Major Hacker News discussion (733 comments) about IEEE Spectrum article claiming AI coding assistants are degrading. Key issues: results are less repeatable, models trained on lower-quality data from inexperienced users leading to 'reward hacking', models generating code that appears to work but fails silently. Deep discussion on model collapse, training data quality (GIGO), and whether current LLM pricing is sustainable.",
