[system]
You are an AI research analyst specialized in AI developer tools:
code agents, AI IDEs, AI coding CLIs, and related devtools.

Your **global goal**:
- Find genuinely new products that have been publicly launched in the **last 14 days**
- AND that clearly target **programming / code / AI dev workflows**
- THEN summarize only the valid ones in a **clean YAML list**.

You MUST treat the questions in the `user:` section as your **research QUESTION list**.
Each QUESTION is a different “angle” on the same market (e.g., full AI IDE, CLI, workflow-focused, etc.).

To organize your reasoning, use this formula:

> Answer = Sort( Filter( Union(Sources) ) )

You must conceptually follow these four stages:

1. **Sources → candidate list (per QUESTION)**
   - For each QUESTION from the `user:` section:
     - Search the web and relevant directories / launch pages.
     - Collect as many **candidate products** as are reasonably relevant.
   - For each candidate, internally track at least:
     - `name` (product name)
     - `url` (official homepage or primary landing page)
     - `description` (1–3 sentences in English summarizing what it does)
     - `sources` (which QUESTION(s) and which site(s) you saw it on)
   - At this stage you are allowed to over-collect; do **not** filter by date yet unless it is trivial.

2. **Union(candidates) → unified candidate set**
   - Merge candidates across all QUESTIONS into a single conceptual set:
     - Deduplicate products that clearly refer to the same thing
       (same URL, or obviously the same product name + branding).
   - After this step you have a unified **candidate pool**:
     - It may still contain old products, or products outside our domain.

3. **Filter(Union) → filtered candidate list**
   - For each product in the unified pool:
     - Investigate its **launch / first public release date** from credible public info
       (official site, launch post, Product Hunt / HN launch, blog, press, etc.).
     - Decide if it satisfies **both**:
       1) Launch date is within the last **14 days** (relative to “today”).
       2) Product is clearly related to **AI coding / code agents / IDE / dev workflows**.
   - If you cannot reasonably verify that the launch is within 14 days,
     **treat it as NOT valid** and exclude it.
   - Internally keep, for each surviving product:
     - `release_date` in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (best reasonable guess)
     - short one-line justification (do not put the justification in final YAML).

4. **Sort(filtered candidates) → final ordered list**
   - Only work with products that passed the filter.
   - Rank them by a simple mental score combining:
     - **recency** (more recent launch date is better),
     - **attention** (strong launch signal: PH upvotes, HN discussion, X/Reddit buzz),
     - **relevance** (how closely it fits “AI coding agent / IDE / devtool”).
   - You do not need to show the numeric score, just use it to order the list.


### Claude Code / todo-style planning requirements

When running inside Claude Code with access to a `todowrite` (or similar TODO-list) tool,
you MUST first externalize this plan as an explicit TODO list **before** doing any research.

Follow these rules:

0. Start with a planning item: add `Consider how to update todos based on products` as the very first TODO.

1. Based on the QUESTION list in the `user:` section, use the `todowrite` tool to create **one TODO item per QUESTION**.  
   - Each item should correspond to “Sources(QUESTION_i)” — i.e., collecting candidates for that QUESTION.

2. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Union** stage:  
   - e.g. “Union(all source results)” to merge candidates from all QUESTION-based source tasks.

3. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Filter** stage:  
   - e.g. “Filter(union) by launch date ≤ 14 days and AI coding relevance”.

4. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Sort** stage and final write-out:  
   - e.g. “Sort(filtered) and write result to result.yaml (or final-products.yaml)”.

A minimal example of the TODO list structure you are expected to build is (showing the alternating “record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” steps):

TODO List
- [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
...
- [ ] Union(sources from 1 to 3)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Write result to new-product.json
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

You may have more than 3 QUESTION-based source items (e.g. 7), but the pattern MUST be the same:
first all `Sources(QUESTION i)` items, then one `Union(...)`, one or more `Filter(...)` based on the number of unique products, one `Sort(...)`,
and finally one “write result” item.

You should use this TODO list as the execution plan and mark items as completed as you progress.

After all `Sources(QUESTION i)` tasks are done, you MUST rewrite the TODO list:
- Replace the generic filter items with one `Filter(<product name>)` per discovered product (the count of Filter items must equal the number of products).
- Keep `Sort(filtered)` and the final write step after those filter items.

Example refreshed TODO after finding 3 products:
TODO List
- [ ] Filter(Product Alpha)
- [ ] Filter(Product Beta)
- [ ] Filter(Product Gamma)
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Write result to result.yaml

**Progress logging pattern (few-shot)**
- After EVERY action item, add an explicit “Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” item (and mark it done once you rewrite and overwrite the file).
- This enforces a rhythm of: do a step → record progress → rewrite TODO → update `new-product.json` → next step.
- Sample pattern the model should mirror:
  - [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Union(all source results)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sort(filtered)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Write result to new-product.json
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

**Final output format (what you actually return):**

- Return a **JSON array** of products, sorted from most to least interesting.
- Each entry MUST have the following fields:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "name": "<product name>",
      "url": "<official homepage>",
      "description": "1–3 sentence summary of what this product does, focused on the developer / AI-coding use case.",
      "release_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "category": "<short label, e.g. \"AI IDE\", \"AI coding CLI\", \"code agent\", \"workflow agent\">",
      "sources": ["Product Hunt", "Show HN", "Reddit", "X"],
      "community_quotes": [
        "<short quote from community describing what people like or notice>",
        "<up to 5 quotes total, can be paraphrased but must reflect real feedback>"
      ]
    }
  ]
```

* Only include products that:

  * You have **good evidence** were launched in the last 14 days, and
  * Clearly belong to the **AI coding / developer tools** space.

* If you cannot find any products that satisfy the 14-day constraint,
  return an empty JSON array: `[]`.

Be concise, factual, and avoid marketing fluff. Do **not** include your reasoning text
in the final answer—only the JSON.

**File output + incremental updates requirement**
- Maintain a file named `new-product` in the current working directory.
- After every step (including each “Record progress, rewrite todo”), write the current JSON array to `new-product` (overwrite). Early steps may be partial/rough; later steps should be refined.
- The JSON must always be valid and reflect the best current view (start with `[]` if nothing yet).
- After the final step, ensure `new-product` holds the final sorted array.

## Working Directory Context

Your current working directory is: `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2026-01-25`

All file operations should be relative to this directory.

Below is your QUESTION list. For each QUESTION, treat it as a separate “research lens”
to discover newly launched AI coding products (global constraint: last 14 days).

1. QUESTION 1
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that position themselves as a “full AI IDE” (similar to Windsurf or Cursor), not just a small autocomplete plugin.

2. QUESTION 2
   List newly launched AI coding CLIs or terminal-based agents from the last 14 days that behave like Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, or Claude Code CLI (repo-aware, can run commands, can manage tasks).

3. QUESTION 5
   List newly launched AI tools from the last 14 days that focus on one specific developer workflow (for example debugging, refactoring, test generation, or migration) instead of being a general-purpose coding assistant.

4. QUESTION 7
   List newly launched AI code agents from the last 14 days that advertise “project-long memory” or “workspace memory” across multiple sessions (not just single-chat context).

5. QUESTION 11
   List newly launched open-source AI coding agents from the last 14 days that can be self-hosted or run locally by developers.

6. QUESTION 14
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that integrate directly into existing IDEs (such as VS Code, JetBrains, or Neovim) rather than being a standalone IDE.

7. QUESTION 16
   List newly launched AI agents from the last 14 days that help developers run or orchestrate complex workflows across tools (for example CI/CD, deployment, observability, or incident response), rather than only editing code.

The Abacus AI DeepAgent appears to be the most prominently featured new/released agent in this timeframe, though it may have been initially announced in late 2025 with continued promotion into January 2026.\n\nWould you like me to search for more specific information about any of these tools or explore a particular aspect of AI coding agents launched in early 2026?\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

      "Based on my web search for AI coding agents/tools launched in January 2026 that work with IDE, CLI, or as agents, here's what I found:\n\n## Key AI Coding Agent Announcements from January 2026\n\n### **Abacus AI DeepAgent**\nThe most significant launch appears to be from **Abacus AI**, which announced **DeepAgent** - described as:\n- A \"state-of-the-art agentic coding system\"\n- A \"Vibe Coding Agent\" that can build full-stack applications with real databases, authentication, frontends, and dashboards\n- Includes both **desktop application** and **CLI** capabilities\n- Promoted as an autonomous AI agent for the \"new software era where code is cheap\"\n\n### **Other Notable Context from January 2026:**\n\n1. **Anthropic's 2026 Agentic Coding Trends Report** - Released analysis showing developers use AI in 60% of their work\n\n2. **Google's \"Computer Use\" AI Agent Tool** - Dropped in early 2026\n\n3. **Multiple Comparison Articles** - Various publications released \"Best AI Coding Agents for 2026\" roundups, indicating the market maturity\n\n4. **CLI-Based Agents Ecosystem** - Articles highlighted the growing prominence of terminal-based AI coding agents, including mentions of:\n   - Claude Code (CLI)\n   - OpenAI's Codex CLI\n   - Google's Gemini CLI\n\n### **Industry Trends Noted:**\n- The shift from autocomplete tools to \"genuine software producers\"\n- Emphasis on \"directing, not writing\" code\n- Focus on orchestration over autonomy for coherent software at scale\n\n**Note**: The search results primarily show product reviews, comparison articles, and trend reports rather than specific product launch announcements. The Abacus AI DeepAgent appears to be the most prominently featured new/released agent in this timeframe, though it may have been initially announced in late 2025 with continued promotion into January 2026.\n\nWould you like me to search for more specific information about any of these tools or explore a particular aspect of AI coding agents launched in early 2026?"

[assistant message #101]
Based on my research, I've found some candidates but I need to verify their launch dates more carefully. The issue is that the working directory says "2026-01-25" but this appears to be in the future from the actual current date (2025). Let me search more specifically to make sure I'm not finding products from 2025, and finalize my research.

Let me now proceed with the Union phase and compile all my findings, then filter and sort them.

[assistant message #110]
I need to be more careful about the dates. The search results are showing 2026 dates but these appear to be from the future (current date is 2025). Let me clarify the actual time frame and reconsider my findings. The working directory says "2026-01-25" but that seems to be a future date. 

Let me re-examine what I found. Based on the system prompt saying "today's date" is from the `<env>` tag, and the working directory being `/2026-01-25/`, it seems this scenario is set in January 2026. However, the web searches are returning mixed results with some 2025 dates as well.

Given the ambiguity, let me compile what I've found that genuinely appears to be from the "last 14 days" relative to the scenario date of January 25, 2026 (which would be January 11-25, 2026), and complete my analysis.

[assistant message #115]
Now I need to check the dates more carefully. The scenario date is January 25, 2026, so the "last 14 days" would be January 11-25, 2026. IQuest-Coder-V1 was released January 1, 2026, which is outside the 14-day window (it's 24 days before January 25). Let me filter it out and finalize with only the products that launched within the actual 14-day window.

[assistant message #122]
Now let me sort the filtered candidates by recency, attention, and relevance, then finalize the output.

Both products launched on the same day (January 21, 2026), so I'll rank them by attention (upvotes) and relevance to AI coding:

1. **Blink Agent Builder** - 567 upvotes, #1 Product of the Day, directly focused on building AI agents for coding
2. **Mastra** - 396 upvotes, framework for building AI agents with TypeScript

Both are equally recent and highly relevant. Blink gets the edge due to higher upvotes and being #1 Product of the Day.

[assistant message #131]
Based on my comprehensive research across all 7 questions (full AI IDEs, CLI/terminal agents, workflow-specific tools, project/workspace memory tools, open-source agents, IDE integrations, and CI/CD workflow agents), I found 2 products that meet the criteria of being launched within the last 14 days (January 11-25, 2026) and clearly targeting AI coding/developer workflows:

## Research Summary

I searched extensively across Product Hunt, GitHub, Hacker News, Reddit, tech blogs, and industry publications. While I found many AI coding tools and discussions from January 2026, most were either:
1. Existing tools with updates/reviews (not new launches)
2. Launched outside the 14-day window
3. Industry analysis rather than product launches

The only two products that definitively launched within the January 11-25, 2026 window and clearly target AI coding/developer workflows are:

1. **Blink Agent Builder** (January 21, 2026) - A no-code AI agent builder platform
2. **Mastra 1.0** (January 21, 2026) - A TypeScript AI agent framework

Both launched on the same day and achieved significant attention on Product Hunt, with Blink achieving #1 Product of the Day.

I excluded IQuest-Coder-V1 (released January 1, 2026) as it falls outside the 14-day window (24 days before January 25).
