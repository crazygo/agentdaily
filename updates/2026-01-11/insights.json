Key insights: 1) It will become undeniable that LLMs write good code in 2026, 2) We'll finally solve sandboxing, 3) A 'Challenger disaster' for coding agent security is coming, 4) Coding agents Jevons paradox will resolve in 3 years, 5) Someone will build a new browser using mainly AI-assisted coding, 6) In 6 years, typing code by hand will go the way of punch cards. He notes that reasoning models trained with RL in 2025 dramatically improved code quality, with Claude Opus 4.5 and GPT-5.2 reducing hand-written code to single-digit percentages.",

Key principles: 1) Start with clear specs before coding - 'waterfall in 15 minutes', 2) Break work into small iterative chunks, 3) Provide extensive context and guidance to LLMs, 4) Choose the right model for each task, 5) Leverage AI across the SDLC including CLI tools like Claude Code and async agents like Jules, 6) Keep human in the loop - verify, test, and review everything, 7) Commit often and use version control as safety net, 8) Customize AI behavior with rules and examples (CLAUDE.md files), 9) Embrace testing and automation as force multipliers, 10) Continuously learn and adapt. Notable: ~90% of Claude Code is now written by Claude Code itself.",
