You are an AI research analyst focused on AI coding thought leadership. Track recent insights with disciplined TODO planning and continuous file updates.
Global goal:
- Find technical insights/opinions/discussions in the **last 7 days** from the provided thought leaders and sources.
- Return a clean JSON array of insights, sorted by recency/relevance.
- Keep `insights.json` valid and updated after every step (start with `[]` if empty).
### TODO planning rules
- Start with `Consider how to update todos based on insights`.
- Create one `Sources(<leader/source>)` item per thought leader (and any extra sources you add).
- After each action, add and complete: `Record progress, rewrite todo, update insights.json`.
- After all Sources are done, rewrite the TODO list so Filters are per insight found (one `Filter(<insight title or source>)` per insight), then include `Sort(filtered)` and `Write result to insights.json`.

## Working Directory Context

Your current working directory is: `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2026-01-11`

All file operations should be relative to this directory.

---

**Today's Date**: {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE}
**Date Range**: {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE} minus 7 days = {INSERT_START_DATE}
**IMPORTANT TIME CONSTRAINTS**:
- Only include content published/posted between {INSERT_START_DATE} and {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE}
- When searching, ALWAYS use date filters: "after:{INSERT_START_DATE} before:{INSERT_CURRENT_DATE}" or equivalent date range syntax
- For Twitter/X: Use advanced search with date range filters
- For Google/Blog searches: Use "after:{INSERT_START_DATE}" or site-specific date filters
- For Hacker News/Reddit: Filter by time period (past week) or use date-based search
- For YouTube: Use upload date filter (last 7 days)
- **CRITICAL**: If a source does not have a clear publication date within the 7-day window, EXCLUDE it from results
- Verify publication dates before including in insights.json

Output format (JSON array):
```json
[
  {
    "title": "Headline or discussion topic",
    "description": "Summary of key points and takeaways",
    "author": "Who wrote or said it",
    "source": "Blog | Twitter | YouTube | Podcast | TechMedia | HN | Reddit | Paper | Platform",
    "url": "https://link-to-content",
    "published_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "topics": ["Relevant", "Tags", "Here"],
    "type": "technical | opinion | tutorial | discussion"
  }
]
```
- **Date validation**: Each insight MUST include a `published_date` field, and it MUST be within the 7-day window ({INSERT_START_DATE} to {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE})
- If no valid insights in the 7-day window, return `[]`.
File output + incremental updates:
- Maintain `insights.json` in the current working directory.
- After every step (including each "Record progress, rewrite todo"), overwrite `insights.json` with the best current JSON (start with `[]` if nothing yet).
- **Before writing to insights.json**: Verify that each insight's `published_date` is within the 7-day window. Remove any insights outside this range.
- Final state must hold the sorted array of insights (sorted by date, most recent first).

[assistant message #2]
I'll help you gather AI coding thought leadership insights from the last 7 days. Let me start by setting up the TODO list and understanding the current state.

      "## Search Results for \"2026-01\" karpathy AI coding LLM (Twitter/X)\n\nI found several relevant results from Twitter/X related to Andrej Karpathy and AI coding, though the specific query for \"2026-01\" didn't match exact posts from that date range. Here are the key findings:\n\n### Recent Posts from Andrej Karpathy (@karpathy)\n\n1. **From ~3 weeks ago**: Karpathy posted about \"Claude Code / AI that lives on your computer\", describing it as \"the first convincing demonstration of what an LLM Agent looks like\"\n\n2. **From ~2 weeks ago**: He tweeted: \"I've never felt this much behind as a programmer. The profession is being dramatically refactored as the bits...\"\n\n3. **Vibe Coding** - From ~11 months ago: Karpathy introduced the concept of \"vibe coding\" - \"a new kind of coding where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials\"\n\n4. **AI-Assisted Coding Patterns** - From ~8 months ago: A post discussing \"a certain rhythm in AI-assisted coding\"\n\n### Related Content\n\nThe search also found several Chinese-language AI news sources discussing Karpathy's \"vibe coding\" concept and its impact throughout 2025, suggesting his ideas about AI-assisted programming have been highly influential.\n\n**Note**: The specific date filter \"2026-01\" didn't return exact matches, which could indicate either:\n- No posts from Karpathy specifically dated January 2026 yet (the search results show posts from late 2025)\n- The date may be in the future relative to when these posts were made\n- Some results reference \"2026-01\" in content discussing predictions or future-looking statements about AI development\n\nWould you like me to search with different parameters or without the date filter to find more comprehensive results about Karpathy's views on AI coding and LLMs?"

I notice the search results don't show specific posts from Karpathy in the January 4-11, 2026 window. Let me check if there's an actual tweet from that specific status ID and move on to gather insights from other sources. Let me record what I have and continue with Simon Willison:

I can see some Hacker News discussions, but I need to check which ones are actually from the past 7 days (Jan 4-11, 2026). The insights.json already has two HN discussions from Jan 9-10, 2026. Let me search for ArXiv papers and other technical sources:
