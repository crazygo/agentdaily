[system]
You are an AI research analyst specialized in AI developer tools:
code agents, AI IDEs, AI coding CLIs, and related devtools.

Your **global goal**:
- Find genuinely new products that have been publicly launched in the **last 14 days**
- AND that clearly target **programming / code / AI dev workflows**
- THEN summarize only the valid ones in a **clean YAML list**.

You MUST treat the questions in the `user:` section as your **research QUESTION list**.
Each QUESTION is a different “angle” on the same market (e.g., full AI IDE, CLI, workflow-focused, etc.).

To organize your reasoning, use this formula:

> Answer = Sort( Filter( Union(Sources) ) )

You must conceptually follow these four stages:

1. **Sources → candidate list (per QUESTION)**
   - For each QUESTION from the `user:` section:
     - Search the web and relevant directories / launch pages.
     - Collect as many **candidate products** as are reasonably relevant.
   - For each candidate, internally track at least:
     - `name` (product name)
     - `url` (official homepage or primary landing page)
     - `description` (1–3 sentences in English summarizing what it does)
     - `sources` (which QUESTION(s) and which site(s) you saw it on)
   - At this stage you are allowed to over-collect; do **not** filter by date yet unless it is trivial.

2. **Union(candidates) → unified candidate set**
   - Merge candidates across all QUESTIONS into a single conceptual set:
     - Deduplicate products that clearly refer to the same thing
       (same URL, or obviously the same product name + branding).
   - After this step you have a unified **candidate pool**:
     - It may still contain old products, or products outside our domain.

3. **Filter(Union) → filtered candidate list**
   - For each product in the unified pool:
     - Investigate its **launch / first public release date** from credible public info
       (official site, launch post, Product Hunt / HN launch, blog, press, etc.).
     - Decide if it satisfies **both**:
       1) Launch date is within the last **14 days** (relative to “today”).
       2) Product is clearly related to **AI coding / code agents / IDE / dev workflows**.
   - If you cannot reasonably verify that the launch is within 14 days,
     **treat it as NOT valid** and exclude it.
   - Internally keep, for each surviving product:
     - `release_date` in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (best reasonable guess)
     - short one-line justification (do not put the justification in final YAML).

4. **Sort(filtered candidates) → final ordered list**
   - Only work with products that passed the filter.
   - Rank them by a simple mental score combining:
     - **recency** (more recent launch date is better),
     - **attention** (strong launch signal: PH upvotes, HN discussion, X/Reddit buzz),
     - **relevance** (how closely it fits “AI coding agent / IDE / devtool”).
   - You do not need to show the numeric score, just use it to order the list.


### Claude Code / todo-style planning requirements

When running inside Claude Code with access to a `todowrite` (or similar TODO-list) tool,
you MUST first externalize this plan as an explicit TODO list **before** doing any research.

Follow these rules:

0. Start with a planning item: add `Consider how to update todos based on products` as the very first TODO.

1. Based on the QUESTION list in the `user:` section, use the `todowrite` tool to create **one TODO item per QUESTION**.  
   - Each item should correspond to “Sources(QUESTION_i)” — i.e., collecting candidates for that QUESTION.

2. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Union** stage:  
   - e.g. “Union(all source results)” to merge candidates from all QUESTION-based source tasks.

3. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Filter** stage:  
   - e.g. “Filter(union) by launch date ≤ 14 days and AI coding relevance”.

4. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Sort** stage and final write-out:  
   - e.g. “Sort(filtered) and write result to result.yaml (or final-products.yaml)”.

A minimal example of the TODO list structure you are expected to build is (showing the alternating “record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” steps):

TODO List
- [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
...
- [ ] Union(sources from 1 to 3)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Write result to new-product.json
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

You may have more than 3 QUESTION-based source items (e.g. 7), but the pattern MUST be the same:
first all `Sources(QUESTION i)` items, then one `Union(...)`, one or more `Filter(...)` based on the number of unique products, one `Sort(...)`,
and finally one “write result” item.

You should use this TODO list as the execution plan and mark items as completed as you progress.

After all `Sources(QUESTION i)` tasks are done, you MUST rewrite the TODO list:
- Replace the generic filter items with one `Filter(<product name>)` per discovered product (the count of Filter items must equal the number of products).
- Keep `Sort(filtered)` and the final write step after those filter items.

Example refreshed TODO after finding 3 products:
TODO List
- [ ] Filter(Product Alpha)
- [ ] Filter(Product Beta)
- [ ] Filter(Product Gamma)
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Write result to result.yaml

**Progress logging pattern (few-shot)**
- After EVERY action item, add an explicit “Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” item (and mark it done once you rewrite and overwrite the file).
- This enforces a rhythm of: do a step → record progress → rewrite TODO → update `new-product.json` → next step.
- Sample pattern the model should mirror:
  - [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Union(all source results)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sort(filtered)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Write result to new-product.json
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

**Final output format (what you actually return):**

- Return a **JSON array** of products, sorted from most to least interesting.
- Each entry MUST have the following fields:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "name": "<product name>",
      "url": "<official homepage>",
      "description": "1–3 sentence summary of what this product does, focused on the developer / AI-coding use case.",
      "release_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "category": "<short label, e.g. \"AI IDE\", \"AI coding CLI\", \"code agent\", \"workflow agent\">",
      "sources": ["Product Hunt", "Show HN", "Reddit", "X"],
      "community_quotes": [
        "<short quote from community describing what people like or notice>",
        "<up to 5 quotes total, can be paraphrased but must reflect real feedback>"
      ]
    }
  ]
```

* Only include products that:

  * You have **good evidence** were launched in the last 14 days, and
  * Clearly belong to the **AI coding / developer tools** space.

* If you cannot find any products that satisfy the 14-day constraint,
  return an empty JSON array: `[]`.

Be concise, factual, and avoid marketing fluff. Do **not** include your reasoning text
in the final answer—only the JSON.

**File output + incremental updates requirement**
- Maintain a file named `new-product` in the current working directory.
- After every step (including each “Record progress, rewrite todo”), write the current JSON array to `new-product` (overwrite). Early steps may be partial/rough; later steps should be refined.
- The JSON must always be valid and reflect the best current view (start with `[]` if nothing yet).
- After the final step, ensure `new-product` holds the final sorted array.

## Working Directory Context

Your current working directory is: `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2026-01-11`

All file operations should be relative to this directory.

---

Below is your QUESTION list. For each QUESTION, treat it as a separate “research lens”
to discover newly launched AI coding products (global constraint: last 14 days).

1. QUESTION 1
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that position themselves as a “full AI IDE” (similar to Windsurf or Cursor), not just a small autocomplete plugin.

2. QUESTION 2
   List newly launched AI coding CLIs or terminal-based agents from the last 14 days that behave like Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, or Claude Code CLI (repo-aware, can run commands, can manage tasks).

3. QUESTION 5
   List newly launched AI tools from the last 14 days that focus on one specific developer workflow (for example debugging, refactoring, test generation, or migration) instead of being a general-purpose coding assistant.

4. QUESTION 7
   List newly launched AI code agents from the last 14 days that advertise “project-long memory” or “workspace memory” across multiple sessions (not just single-chat context).

5. QUESTION 11
   List newly launched open-source AI coding agents from the last 14 days that can be self-hosted or run locally by developers.

6. QUESTION 14
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that integrate directly into existing IDEs (such as VS Code, JetBrains, or Neovim) rather than being a standalone IDE.

7. QUESTION 16
   List newly launched AI agents from the last 14 days that help developers run or orchestrate complex workflows across tools (for example CI/CD, deployment, observability, or incident response), rather than only editing code.

[assistant message #2]
I'll help you discover newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days. Let me start by creating a structured TODO list and then systematically research each question.

Here's what I found:\n\n## Key Findings\n\nWhile I didn't find a specific AI IDE launch in January 2026, the search results provide valuable information about the AI IDE landscape and alternatives to Cursor and Windsurf:\n\n### Main AI IDE Players on Product Hunt:\n1. **Cursor** - Has significantly more popularity with 845 Shoutouts vs Windsurf's 2\n2. **Windsurf** - Built by the Codeium team, marketed as \"the first agentic IDE\"\n3. **GitHub Copilot** - Traditional AI coding assistant\n4. **Replit** - Cloud-based development environment\n5. **Kiro** - Mentioned as a Windsurf alternative\n6. **Trae** - Another AI IDE option\n7. **Claude Code** - Anthropic's coding assistant\n8. **NxCode** - AI app builder/code editor hybrid\n\n### Cursor vs Windsurf Comparison:\n- **Cursor** is notably more popular on Product Hunt but can feel \"cluttered with AI buttons\"\n- **Windsurf** takes an \"Apple-like approach to design\" and is considered the leader in cascade/iterative workflows\n- Cursor 1.0 launched on June 6th, 2025, ranking #3 of the week\n\n### Market Context:\nThe search results show active competition in the AI IDE space throughout 2025-2026, with multiple alternatives emerging. The articles discuss \"AI Coding Platform Wars\" involving Replit, Windsurf, and Bolt.new.\n\n**Note:** If you're looking for a specific AI IDE that launched in January 2026, it may not have appeared in these results, or the launch might be scheduled for a future date since the current date shown is June 2025 in the most recent results.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

Instead, the results primarily show articles about AI coding tools in general for 2026, not specifically tied to CES announcements.\n\n### What the Results Show:\n\n**General AI Coding Tools for 2026:**\n1. **Best AI Coding Agents for 2026** - Article comparing Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Copilot, Cline, and more (Faros.ai)\n2. **Beyond Autocomplete: The 2026 AI Toolset** - Article discussing how IDEs are becoming agentic systems (dev.to)\n3. **Top 10 Best AI Coding Tools 2026** - Lists \"Inside your editor\" copilots including Copilot, Codeium, Tabnine, Claude Code, Amazon Q Developer\n\n**Key AI Coding Tools Mentioned:**\n- Cursor (v2026 Pro) - described as the benchmark for AI-native IDEs\n- GitHub Copilot G3\n- Windsurf (formerly Codeium) - \"The Agentic IDE Powerhouse\"\n- Zed with Anthropic Claude 4 (Local-First)\n- JetBrains AI\n- Amazon Q Developer\n\n### What's Missing:\nThe search didn't return any CES 2026-specific announcements about AI coding IDEs or developer tools. This could mean:\n- No major AI coding IDE announcements were made at CES 2026\n- Such announcements might not be widely covered online yet\n- The search query might need refinement\n\nWould you like me to search with more specific terms or check for CES 2026 announcements from specific companies (like Microsoft, Google, JetBrains, etc.)?"

[assistant message #72]
Based on my extensive research across multiple sources and question angles, I need to acknowledge an important finding: **I could not identify any AI coding/developer tools that were clearly launched in the last 14 days** (December 29, 2025 - January 11, 2026 in the simulated context).

While I found many articles discussing AI coding tools, trends for 2026, and comprehensive landscape repositories, these were either:
1. General comparison/best-of articles (not new launches)
2. Tools that launched earlier in 2025 or late 2024
3. Prediction/trend articles for 2026
4. Resources/curations rather than new product launches

Let me now complete my research systematically by recording my findings and proceeding through the remaining questions to be thorough.

Open Source Terminal AI Agent\n- **What it is**: An open-source AI coding agent designed to work directly in your terminal\n- **Key features**: \n  - Runs directly in your terminal environment\n  - LSP (Language Server Protocol) enabled\n  - Automatically loads the right LSPs for the LLM\n  - Described as \"having a senior developer sitting next to you\"\n- **Website**: https://opencode.ai/\n\n### 2. **Claude Code** (from Anthropic)\n- Heavily featured in multiple 2026 coding agent roundups\n- Deep-context AI coder that integrates with terminal workflows\n- Frequently mentioned alongside Cursor in developer discussions\n\n### 3. **China's New Coding AI**\n- One article mentions China releasing \"the first coding AI of 2026\" on January 2, 2026\n- Claims it's \"crushing everything we know\" compared to Claude Sonnet 4.5 and GPT models\n\n### Other Notable Terminal AI Tools Mentioned:\n- **Gemini CLI**: Brought AI directly into command line interfaces\n- **Cursor AI Agent**: Can execute terminal commands directly within the editor\n- **Cline**: Frequently mentioned in 2026 AI coding agent comparisons\n\nThe search results indicate that early 2026 saw significant activity in terminal-based AI coding tools, with a particular focus on bringing AI assistance directly into command line environments rather than just IDE integrations.\n\nWould you like me to search for more specific information about any of these tools?\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

Based on my comprehensive research across all question areas, I need to finalize my findings. The most concrete finding I discovered was:

1. **Visual Studio 2026 AI-Driven Debugging Tools** - Announced December 18, 2025 (within the 14-day window from December 29, 2025)

However, I need to verify this more carefully and also check the "China's First Coding AI of 2026" article. Let me investigate those specific leads before concluding:

## Summary

I completed a comprehensive research investigation across all 7 question areas, searching for AI coding/developer tools launched in the last 14 days (December 29, 2025 - January 11, 2026). Here's what I found:

### Research Methodology
- Searched Product Hunt, Hacker News (Show HN), Reddit, GitHub trending repositories
- Investigated technical news sources (TechCrunch, InfoQ, DEV Community)
- Checked CES 2026 announcements and other launch venues
- Explored GitHub topics, AI coding landscapes, and open-source repositories

### Key Finding
After extensive research across all categories (full AI IDEs, CLI agents, workflow-specific tools, workspace memory agents, open-source tools, IDE integrations, and orchestration agents), I found **only one product** that clearly meets the criteria:

**IQuest-Coder-V1**
- **Release Date:** January 1, 2026
- **Developer:** IQuest Lab (AI research arm of Ubiquant, a Chinese quantitative hedge fund managing $10B+ in assets)
- **What it is:** An open-source coding AI model family with 7B-40B parameter variants
- **Key Innovation:** Uses "Code-Flow Training" - learns from commit histories, repository evolution patterns, and dynamic code transformations rather than just static code snapshots
- **Performance:** Matches or beats Claude Sonnet 4.5 and GPT models on major benchmarks (SWE-Bench Verified: 76.2%, LiveCodeBench v6: 81.1%, BigCodeBench: 49.9%) while being 10-20x smaller (40B vs 400-800B parameters)
- **Specialization:** Two variants - Instruct (general coding) and Thinking (complex reasoning with reinforcement learning)
- **Availability:** Fully open source with weights, training code, and evaluation scripts on GitHub

### Sources
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/IQuestLab/IQuest-Coder-V1)
- [DEV Community Article](https://dev.to/yakhilesh/china-just-released-the-first-coding-ai-of-2026-and-its-crushing-everything-we-know-3bbj)
- [Technical Report](https://iquestlab.github.io/)

The result has been written to `new-product.json` in the required format.
