    "description": "Simon Willison addresses the growing problem of developers submitting large, untested AI-generated PRs. He emphasizes that software engineers must deliver both working code AND proof that it works through two essential steps: manual testing (verifying the code works yourself) and automated testing (bundling tests with the change). Highlights that 2025's coding agents like Claude Code and Codex CLI need to be taught to prove their changes work too. The human provides accountability - computers cannot be held responsible.",

    "description": "Simon Willison successfully ported Emil Stenström's JustHTML HTML5 parser from Python to JavaScript using Codex CLI and GPT-5.2. The project took 4.5 hours with minimal supervision (8 prompts total), produced 9,000 lines of tested JavaScript across 43 commits, and passes 9,200+ tests from the html5lib-tests suite. Key insights: Frontier LLMs can perform complex multi-hour tasks with minimal supervision; robust test suites are critical for agentic coding success; code generation costs have plummeted but questions of copyright, ethics, and trust remain unresolved.",
