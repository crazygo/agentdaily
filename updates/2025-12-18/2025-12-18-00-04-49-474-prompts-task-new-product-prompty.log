[system]
You are an AI research analyst specialized in AI developer tools:
code agents, AI IDEs, AI coding CLIs, and related devtools.

Your **global goal**:
- Find genuinely new products that have been publicly launched in the **last 14 days**
- AND that clearly target **programming / code / AI dev workflows**
- THEN summarize only the valid ones in a **clean YAML list**.

You MUST treat the questions in the `user:` section as your **research QUESTION list**.
Each QUESTION is a different “angle” on the same market (e.g., full AI IDE, CLI, workflow-focused, etc.).

To organize your reasoning, use this formula:

> Answer = Sort( Filter( Union(Sources) ) )

You must conceptually follow these four stages:

1. **Sources → candidate list (per QUESTION)**
   - For each QUESTION from the `user:` section:
     - Search the web and relevant directories / launch pages.
     - Collect as many **candidate products** as are reasonably relevant.
   - For each candidate, internally track at least:
     - `name` (product name)
     - `url` (official homepage or primary landing page)
     - `description` (1–3 sentences in English summarizing what it does)
     - `sources` (which QUESTION(s) and which site(s) you saw it on)
   - At this stage you are allowed to over-collect; do **not** filter by date yet unless it is trivial.

2. **Union(candidates) → unified candidate set**
   - Merge candidates across all QUESTIONS into a single conceptual set:
     - Deduplicate products that clearly refer to the same thing
       (same URL, or obviously the same product name + branding).
   - After this step you have a unified **candidate pool**:
     - It may still contain old products, or products outside our domain.

3. **Filter(Union) → filtered candidate list**
   - For each product in the unified pool:
     - Investigate its **launch / first public release date** from credible public info
       (official site, launch post, Product Hunt / HN launch, blog, press, etc.).
     - Decide if it satisfies **both**:
       1) Launch date is within the last **14 days** (relative to “today”).
       2) Product is clearly related to **AI coding / code agents / IDE / dev workflows**.
   - If you cannot reasonably verify that the launch is within 14 days,
     **treat it as NOT valid** and exclude it.
   - Internally keep, for each surviving product:
     - `release_date` in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (best reasonable guess)
     - short one-line justification (do not put the justification in final YAML).

4. **Sort(filtered candidates) → final ordered list**
   - Only work with products that passed the filter.
   - Rank them by a simple mental score combining:
     - **recency** (more recent launch date is better),
     - **attention** (strong launch signal: PH upvotes, HN discussion, X/Reddit buzz),
     - **relevance** (how closely it fits “AI coding agent / IDE / devtool”).
   - You do not need to show the numeric score, just use it to order the list.


### Claude Code / todo-style planning requirements

When running inside Claude Code with access to a `todowrite` (or similar TODO-list) tool,
you MUST first externalize this plan as an explicit TODO list **before** doing any research.

Follow these rules:

0. Start with a planning item: add `Consider how to update todos based on products` as the very first TODO.

1. Based on the QUESTION list in the `user:` section, use the `todowrite` tool to create **one TODO item per QUESTION**.  
   - Each item should correspond to “Sources(QUESTION_i)” — i.e., collecting candidates for that QUESTION.

2. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Union** stage:  
   - e.g. “Union(all source results)” to merge candidates from all QUESTION-based source tasks.

3. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Filter** stage:  
   - e.g. “Filter(union) by launch date ≤ 14 days and AI coding relevance”.

4. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Sort** stage and final write-out:  
   - e.g. “Sort(filtered) and write result to result.yaml (or final-products.yaml)”.

A minimal example of the TODO list structure you are expected to build is (showing the alternating “record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” steps):

TODO List
- [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
...
- [ ] Union(sources from 1 to 3)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Write result to new-product.json
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

You may have more than 3 QUESTION-based source items (e.g. 7), but the pattern MUST be the same:
first all `Sources(QUESTION i)` items, then one `Union(...)`, one or more `Filter(...)` based on the number of unique products, one `Sort(...)`,
and finally one “write result” item.

You should use this TODO list as the execution plan and mark items as completed as you progress.

After all `Sources(QUESTION i)` tasks are done, you MUST rewrite the TODO list:
- Replace the generic filter items with one `Filter(<product name>)` per discovered product (the count of Filter items must equal the number of products).
- Keep `Sort(filtered)` and the final write step after those filter items.

Example refreshed TODO after finding 3 products:
TODO List
- [ ] Filter(Product Alpha)
- [ ] Filter(Product Beta)
- [ ] Filter(Product Gamma)
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Write result to result.yaml

**Progress logging pattern (few-shot)**
- After EVERY action item, add an explicit “Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” item (and mark it done once you rewrite and overwrite the file).
- This enforces a rhythm of: do a step → record progress → rewrite TODO → update `new-product.json` → next step.
- Sample pattern the model should mirror:
  - [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Union(all source results)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sort(filtered)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Write result to new-product.json
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

**Final output format (what you actually return):**

- Return a **JSON array** of products, sorted from most to least interesting.
- Each entry MUST have the following fields:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "name": "<product name>",
      "url": "<official homepage>",
      "description": "1–3 sentence summary of what this product does, focused on the developer / AI-coding use case.",
      "release_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "category": "<short label, e.g. \"AI IDE\", \"AI coding CLI\", \"code agent\", \"workflow agent\">",
      "sources": ["Product Hunt", "Show HN", "Reddit", "X"],
      "community_quotes": [
        "<short quote from community describing what people like or notice>",
        "<up to 5 quotes total, can be paraphrased but must reflect real feedback>"
      ]
    }
  ]
```

* Only include products that:

  * You have **good evidence** were launched in the last 14 days, and
  * Clearly belong to the **AI coding / developer tools** space.

* If you cannot find any products that satisfy the 14-day constraint,
  return an empty JSON array: `[]`.

Be concise, factual, and avoid marketing fluff. Do **not** include your reasoning text
in the final answer—only the JSON.

**File output + incremental updates requirement**
- Maintain a file named `new-product` in the current working directory.
- After every step (including each “Record progress, rewrite todo”), write the current JSON array to `new-product` (overwrite). Early steps may be partial/rough; later steps should be refined.
- The JSON must always be valid and reflect the best current view (start with `[]` if nothing yet).
- After the final step, ensure `new-product` holds the final sorted array.

## Working Directory Context

Your current working directory is: `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2025-12-18`

All file operations should be relative to this directory.

---

Below is your QUESTION list. For each QUESTION, treat it as a separate “research lens”
to discover newly launched AI coding products (global constraint: last 14 days).

1. QUESTION 1
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that position themselves as a “full AI IDE” (similar to Windsurf or Cursor), not just a small autocomplete plugin.

2. QUESTION 2
   List newly launched AI coding CLIs or terminal-based agents from the last 14 days that behave like Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, or Claude Code CLI (repo-aware, can run commands, can manage tasks).

3. QUESTION 5
   List newly launched AI tools from the last 14 days that focus on one specific developer workflow (for example debugging, refactoring, test generation, or migration) instead of being a general-purpose coding assistant.

4. QUESTION 7
   List newly launched AI code agents from the last 14 days that advertise “project-long memory” or “workspace memory” across multiple sessions (not just single-chat context).

5. QUESTION 11
   List newly launched open-source AI coding agents from the last 14 days that can be self-hosted or run locally by developers.

6. QUESTION 14
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that integrate directly into existing IDEs (such as VS Code, JetBrains, or Neovim) rather than being a standalone IDE.

7. QUESTION 16
   List newly launched AI agents from the last 14 days that help developers run or orchestrate complex workflows across tools (for example CI/CD, deployment, observability, or incident response), rather than only editing code.

[assistant message #2]

      "Based on my web search, I was unable to find any specific AI IDE or coding tools that were launched on Product Hunt in December 2025. This could be because:\n\n1. **Future date**: December 2025 has not yet occurred (it's currently August 2025), so no launches from that time period would exist\n2. **Limited recent data**: My search filters for recent launches didn't return specific December 2025 AI IDE launches\n\nHowever, I did find some relevant information about AI coding tools and IDEs that have been featured on Product Hunt recently:\n\n## **Recent AI Coding Tools on Product Hunt (2025):**\n\n### **Leading AI Code Editors:**\n- **Cursor** - An AI code editor that launched in June 2025 and was ranked #3 of the week\n- **Claude Code** - Anthropic's deep-context AI coding tool\n- **Windsurf** - Described as \"the first agentic IDE\" built by the Codeium team\n\n### **Notable Recent Launches:**\n- **Dreamflow** - Visual AI builder for production mobile apps\n- **cto.new** - A free AI code agent that plans and ships code\n- **Trae** - \"The Responsive Coding Agent\" which launched in November 2025\n\n### **Current Market Trends:**\nThe search results indicate that 2025 is being called \"the Agentic Era\" for AI coding tools, with a shift from simple IDE chatbots to more sophisticated agentic command-line interfaces and development tools.\n\nIf you're looking for the most current AI IDE launches, I'd recommend checking Product Hunt directly or searching again closer to December 2025 when future launches will have actually occurred."

I realize there's a date issue in my search. Let me search for AI IDE launches from the actual current time period (late November to early December 2024, since we're looking back 14 days from December 18, 2024):

Here are the key findings:\n\n## Major AI Coding CLI/Tools Launched Recently:\n\n### **Claude Code (Anthropic)**\n- **Launch Date**: February 24, 2025\n- A command-line tool for agentic coding\n- Available as a limited research preview initially\n- Built on Claude 3.7 Sonnet model\n- Functions as an AI pair engineer living in your terminal\n\n### **OpenAI Codex CLI**\n- **Launch Date**: April 16, 2025  \n- Open-source terminal-based coding agent\n- Runs locally on your computer\n- Features reasoning and multimodal support\n- OpenAI launched a $1 Million initiative to support open-source projects building on Codex CLI\n\n### **Google Gemini CLI**\n- **Launch Date**: June 25, 2025\n- Open-source AI agent for terminals\n- Integrates Gemini 2.5 Pro with 1M token context\n- Provides code understanding, file manipulation, and command execution\n- Competes directly with Claude Code and Codex CLI\n\n## Notable Patterns:\n- All three major AI companies (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google) launched terminal-based AI coding agents in early 2025\n- These tools represent a trend toward bringing AI assistance directly into developer workflows via the command line\n- Each tool is positioned as an \"agentic\" coding assistant that can understand context, write code, and execute tasks\n\n**Note**: The search results don't show any launches specifically in November/December 2024 for these types of tools. The major launches occurred in early 2025, suggesting this may be when the AI coding CLI trend really accelerated.\n\nWould you like me to search for any specific aspects of these tools or look for other AI coding assistants that might have launched in your specified timeframe?\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

Here's what I discovered:\n\n## Key Findings:\n\n**GitHub Copilot CLI:**\n- **March 21, 2024**: GitHub announced the **General Availability of GitHub Copilot in the CLI** \n- This was originally released as `gh-copilot` version 1.0.0 on March 18, 2024\n- It provides AI-powered coding assistance directly in the command line\n\n**Contradicting Information:**\nSome search results mention a September 2025 release of \"GitHub Copilot CLI\" in public preview, but this appears to be either inaccurate information or possibly a rebranding/relaunch of the existing tool.\n\n## What Was Actually Released November-December 2024:\n\nBased on the search results, **GitHub did not release a new AI coding CLI in November or December 2024**. However, there were other AI coding developments during that period:\n\n1. **Codeium** introduced the Windsurf Editor in November 2024\n2. **GitHub Universe 2024** (October 29, 2024) featured announcements about Copilot enhancements but no new CLI release\n3. **Copilot Free** launched in December 2024, accelerating global adoption\n\n## Current Available GitHub AI CLI Tools:\n\n- **GitHub Copilot CLI** (available since March 2024)\n- **OpenCode** - a Go-based CLI with AI assistance \n- **Google Gemini CLI** - open-source AI agent for terminal development\n\nThe search results suggest that while there was significant activity in the AI coding space during late 2024, GitHub did not release a new AI coding CLI specifically in November or December 2024. The main GitHub AI CLI offering (Copilot CLI) was already available from March 2024.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

Here's what I discovered:\n\n## Key Findings:\n\n**GitHub Copilot CLI:**\n- **March 21, 2024**: GitHub announced the **General Availability of GitHub Copilot in the CLI** \n- This was originally released as `gh-copilot` version 1.0.0 on March 18, 2024\n- It provides AI-powered coding assistance directly in the command line\n\n**Contradicting Information:**\nSome search results mention a September 2025 release of \"GitHub Copilot CLI\" in public preview, but this appears to be either inaccurate information or possibly a rebranding/relaunch of the existing tool.\n\n## What Was Actually Released November-December 2024:\n\nBased on the search results, **GitHub did not release a new AI coding CLI in November or December 2024**. However, there were other AI coding developments during that period:\n\n1. **Codeium** introduced the Windsurf Editor in November 2024\n2. **GitHub Universe 2024** (October 29, 2024) featured announcements about Copilot enhancements but no new CLI release\n3. **Copilot Free** launched in December 2024, accelerating global adoption\n\n## Current Available GitHub AI CLI Tools:\n\n- **GitHub Copilot CLI** (available since March 2024)\n- **OpenCode** - a Go-based CLI with AI assistance \n- **Google Gemini CLI** - open-source AI agent for terminal development\n\nThe search results suggest that while there was significant activity in the AI coding space during late 2024, GitHub did not release a new AI coding CLI specifically in November or December 2024. The main GitHub AI CLI offering (Copilot CLI) was already available from March 2024."

Here's what I discovered:\n\n## Recent AI Terminal/CLI Releases:\n\n### Major Releases Found:\n\n1. **OpenAI Codex CLI** - Recently released AI coding assistant that runs locally in your terminal, capable of reading, modifying, and running code on your machine.\n\n2. **Gemini CLI** - Google's open-source AI agent announced in June 2025, providing code generation, refactoring, and automation capabilities directly in the terminal.\n\n3. **DeepSeek CLI** - A command-line AI coding assistant with intelligent code suggestions across 100+ programming languages.\n\n4. **Continue** - Open-source AI coding assistant that runs in VS Code/JetBrains with a companion CLI for terminal workflows.\n\n### Notable Projects:\n\n- **Rawi (راوي)** - A developer-friendly AI CLI that brings together 11 major AI providers directly to the terminal\n- **tryAGI/AI** - Console utility for AI tasks including text summarization, release notes generation, and code documentation\n- **Kilocode** - All-in-one agentic engineering platform for building and shipping with coding agents\n\n## Timing Issue:\nMost of the major releases I found were either:\n- Earlier in 2024 (like JetBrains AI Assistant 2024.2 in August)\n- Recently in 2025 (like Gemini CLI in June 2025)\n- Lacked specific v1.0 release dates from indie developers\n\nThe search results suggest that while there's significant activity in the AI terminal/CLI space, specific indie developer v1.0 releases during November-December 2024 weren't prominently documented or indexed in the search results available.\n\nWould you like me to search for specific AI CLI tools or look into any particular aspect of AI terminal assistants?\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

      "Based on my search results, I found several interesting AI terminal and CLI tools released recently, though I couldn't find specific v1.0 releases from indie developers in November/December 2024. Here's what I discovered:\n\n## Recent AI Terminal/CLI Releases:\n\n### Major Releases Found:\n\n1. **OpenAI Codex CLI** - Recently released AI coding assistant that runs locally in your terminal, capable of reading, modifying, and running code on your machine.\n\n2. **Gemini CLI** - Google's open-source AI agent announced in June 2025, providing code generation, refactoring, and automation capabilities directly in the terminal.\n\n3. **DeepSeek CLI** - A command-line AI coding assistant with intelligent code suggestions across 100+ programming languages.\n\n4. **Continue** - Open-source AI coding assistant that runs in VS Code/JetBrains with a companion CLI for terminal workflows.\n\n### Notable Projects:\n\n- **Rawi (راوي)** - A developer-friendly AI CLI that brings together 11 major AI providers directly to the terminal\n- **tryAGI/AI** - Console utility for AI tasks including text summarization, release notes generation, and code documentation\n- **Kilocode** - All-in-one agentic engineering platform for building and shipping with coding agents\n\n## Timing Issue:\nMost of the major releases I found were either:\n- Earlier in 2024 (like JetBrains AI Assistant 2024.2 in August)\n- Recently in 2025 (like Gemini CLI in June 2025)\n- Lacked specific v1.0 release dates from indie developers\n\nThe search results suggest that while there's significant activity in the AI terminal/CLI space, specific indie developer v1.0 releases during November-December 2024 weren't prominently documented or indexed in the search results available.\n\nWould you like me to search for specific AI CLI tools or look into any particular aspect of AI terminal assistants?"

Based on my extensive search, I haven't found any AI coding CLI tools that were specifically launched in the November-December 2024 timeframe. Let me move on to the next question and record my progress:

The search results indicate that Cursor launched an AI debugging tool called \"Debug Mode\" very recently (mentioned as \"launched yesterday\" in a LinkedIn post from about 6 days ago). This could potentially align with your timeframe if you're searching in late 2024 or early 2025.\n\n## Related AI Development Tools from 2024:\nThe search returned numerous articles about AI coding tools from 2024, including:\n\n1. **AI Debugging Tools**: Multiple articles discussed AI-powered debugging tools like DeepCode and Code Inspector\n2. **AI Refactoring Tools**: Several tools for code refactoring and optimization were mentioned\n3. **AI Test Generation**: Tools for automated test case generation and migration\n4. **AI Migration Tools**: Various tools for codebase and data migration using AI\n\n## Timing Considerations:\nSince most of the search results are from 2025 (many dated August, October, December 2025), it's possible that:\n- The tools you're looking for were launched as planned in Nov/Dec 2024 but haven't been extensively documented yet\n- The launches may have been delayed or rescheduled\n- The tools may have been announced but not widely covered in the search results\n\n**Recommendation**: If you're looking for a specific tool that was supposed to launch in November/December 2024, you might want to check the official websites or announcements of the companies you had in mind, as they would have the most up-to-date information about their product launches.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

This could potentially align with your timeframe if you're searching in late 2024 or early 2025.\n\n## Related AI Development Tools from 2024:\nThe search returned numerous articles about AI coding tools from 2024, including:\n\n1. **AI Debugging Tools**: Multiple articles discussed AI-powered debugging tools like DeepCode and Code Inspector\n2. **AI Refactoring Tools**: Several tools for code refactoring and optimization were mentioned\n3. **AI Test Generation**: Tools for automated test case generation and migration\n4. **AI Migration Tools**: Various tools for codebase and data migration using AI\n\n## Timing Considerations:\nSince most of the search results are from 2025 (many dated August, October, December 2025), it's possible that:\n- The tools you're looking for were launched as planned in Nov/Dec 2024 but haven't been extensively documented yet\n- The launches may have been delayed or rescheduled\n- The tools may have been announced but not widely covered in the search results\n\n**Recommendation**: If you're looking for a specific tool that was supposed to launch in November/December 2024, you might want to check the official websites or announcements of the companies you had in mind, as they would have the most up-to-date information about their product launches."
