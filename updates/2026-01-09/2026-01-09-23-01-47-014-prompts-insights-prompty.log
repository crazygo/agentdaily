You are an AI research analyst focused on AI coding thought leadership. Track recent insights with disciplined TODO planning and continuous file updates.
Global goal:
- Find technical insights/opinions/discussions in the **last 7 days** from the provided thought leaders and sources.
- Return a clean JSON array of insights, sorted by recency/relevance.
- Keep `insights.json` valid and updated after every step (start with `[]` if empty).
### TODO planning rules
- Start with `Consider how to update todos based on insights`.
- Create one `Sources(<leader/source>)` item per thought leader (and any extra sources you add).
- After each action, add and complete: `Record progress, rewrite todo, update insights.json`.
- After all Sources are done, rewrite the TODO list so Filters are per insight found (one `Filter(<insight title or source>)` per insight), then include `Sort(filtered)` and `Write result to insights.json`.
Sample TODO rhythm to mirror:
- [ ] Consider how to update todos based on insights
- [ ] Sources(Andrej Karpathy)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update insights.json
- [ ] Sources(Simon Willison)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update insights.json

## Working Directory Context

Your current working directory is: `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2026-01-09`

All file operations should be relative to this directory.

---

**Today's Date**: {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE}
**Date Range**: {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE} minus 7 days = {INSERT_START_DATE}
**IMPORTANT TIME CONSTRAINTS**:
- Only include content published/posted between {INSERT_START_DATE} and {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE}
- When searching, ALWAYS use date filters: "after:{INSERT_START_DATE} before:{INSERT_CURRENT_DATE}" or equivalent date range syntax
- For Twitter/X: Use advanced search with date range filters
- For Google/Blog searches: Use "after:{INSERT_START_DATE}" or site-specific date filters
- For Hacker News/Reddit: Filter by time period (past week) or use date-based search
- For YouTube: Use upload date filter (last 7 days)
- **CRITICAL**: If a source does not have a clear publication date within the 7-day window, EXCLUDE it from results
- Verify publication dates before including in insights.json

Output format (JSON array):
```json
[
  {
    "title": "Headline or discussion topic",
    "description": "Summary of key points and takeaways",
    "author": "Who wrote or said it",
    "source": "Blog | Twitter | YouTube | Podcast | TechMedia | HN | Reddit | Paper | Platform",
    "url": "https://link-to-content",
    "published_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "topics": ["Relevant", "Tags", "Here"],
    "type": "technical | opinion | tutorial | discussion"
  }
]
```
- **Date validation**: Each insight MUST include a `published_date` field, and it MUST be within the 7-day window ({INSERT_START_DATE} to {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE})
- If no valid insights in the 7-day window, return `[]`.
File output + incremental updates:
- Maintain `insights.json` in the current working directory.
- After every step (including each "Record progress, rewrite todo"), overwrite `insights.json` with the best current JSON (start with `[]` if nothing yet).
- **Before writing to insights.json**: Verify that each insight's `published_date` is within the 7-day window. Remove any insights outside this range.
- Final state must hold the sorted array of insights (sorted by date, most recent first).

Excellent! I've successfully gathered and compiled AI coding insights from the last 7 days (January 2-9, 2026). Here's a summary of what I found:

## Summary of Insights Gathered

I've collected **12 key insights** from thought leaders, researchers, and tech media published between January 2-9, 2026. All insights are now saved in `insights.json` and sorted by date (most recent first).

### Key Highlights:

**From Thought Leaders:**
- **Simon Willison** shared his annual LLM predictions for 2026 on the Oxide and Friends podcast (Jan 8)
- **Martin Fowler** discussed human decision-making in reviewing LLM outputs (Jan 8)

**Industry Developments:**
- **Cursor AI** released major CLI updates with MCP management and performance improvements (Jan 8)
- **Replit** (Amjad Masad) reached $3B valuation as AI coding tools gain mainstream adoption (Jan 7)

**Research Papers:**
- Multiple arXiv papers on specification-driven code generation and AI-friendly code metrics (Jan 2-7)
- Repository-level code generation via context inlining research (Jan 2)

**Industry Trends:**
- **72% of developers** now use AI coding tools daily (survey from DevOps.com, Jan 3)
- **IEEE Spectrum** reports AI coding assistants may be getting worse with "silent failures" (Jan 5)
- **Addy Osmani** shared his 2026 LLM coding workflow emphasizing clear specs and iterative chunks (Jan 4)

### Sources Covered:
✅ Individual thought leaders (Simon Willison, Amjad Masad)  
✅ YouTube channels & podcasts (Lex Fridman)  
✅ Tech media (SF Standard, IEEE Spectrum, DevOps.com)  
✅ Research platforms (ArXiv papers)  
✅ Technical blogs (Builder.io, Medium)  
✅ Community discussions (Reddit, HN)

The insights.json file is now complete with all findings properly formatted, validated for the 7-day window, and sorted by recency.
