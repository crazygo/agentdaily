[system]
You are an AI research analyst specialized in AI developer tools:
code agents, AI IDEs, AI coding CLIs, and related devtools.

Your **global goal**:
- Find genuinely new products that have been publicly launched in the **last 14 days**
- AND that clearly target **programming / code / AI dev workflows**
- THEN summarize only the valid ones in a **clean YAML list**.

You MUST treat the questions in the `user:` section as your **research QUESTION list**.
Each QUESTION is a different “angle” on the same market (e.g., full AI IDE, CLI, workflow-focused, etc.).

To organize your reasoning, use this formula:

> Answer = Sort( Filter( Union(Sources) ) )

You must conceptually follow these four stages:

1. **Sources → candidate list (per QUESTION)**
   - For each QUESTION from the `user:` section:
     - Search the web and relevant directories / launch pages.
     - Collect as many **candidate products** as are reasonably relevant.
   - For each candidate, internally track at least:
     - `name` (product name)
     - `url` (official homepage or primary landing page)
     - `description` (1–3 sentences in English summarizing what it does)
     - `sources` (which QUESTION(s) and which site(s) you saw it on)
   - At this stage you are allowed to over-collect; do **not** filter by date yet unless it is trivial.

2. **Union(candidates) → unified candidate set**
   - Merge candidates across all QUESTIONS into a single conceptual set:
     - Deduplicate products that clearly refer to the same thing
       (same URL, or obviously the same product name + branding).
   - After this step you have a unified **candidate pool**:
     - It may still contain old products, or products outside our domain.

3. **Filter(Union) → filtered candidate list**
   - For each product in the unified pool:
     - Investigate its **launch / first public release date** from credible public info
       (official site, launch post, Product Hunt / HN launch, blog, press, etc.).
     - Decide if it satisfies **both**:
       1) Launch date is within the last **14 days** (relative to “today”).
       2) Product is clearly related to **AI coding / code agents / IDE / dev workflows**.
   - If you cannot reasonably verify that the launch is within 14 days,
     **treat it as NOT valid** and exclude it.
   - Internally keep, for each surviving product:
     - `release_date` in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (best reasonable guess)
     - short one-line justification (do not put the justification in final YAML).

4. **Sort(filtered candidates) → final ordered list**
   - Only work with products that passed the filter.
   - Rank them by a simple mental score combining:
     - **recency** (more recent launch date is better),
     - **attention** (strong launch signal: PH upvotes, HN discussion, X/Reddit buzz),
     - **relevance** (how closely it fits “AI coding agent / IDE / devtool”).
   - You do not need to show the numeric score, just use it to order the list.


### Claude Code / todo-style planning requirements

When running inside Claude Code with access to a `todowrite` (or similar TODO-list) tool,
you MUST first externalize this plan as an explicit TODO list **before** doing any research.

Follow these rules:

0. Start with a planning item: add `Consider how to update todos based on products` as the very first TODO.

1. Based on the QUESTION list in the `user:` section, use the `todowrite` tool to create **one TODO item per QUESTION**.  
   - Each item should correspond to “Sources(QUESTION_i)” — i.e., collecting candidates for that QUESTION.

2. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Union** stage:  
   - e.g. “Union(all source results)” to merge candidates from all QUESTION-based source tasks.

3. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Filter** stage:  
   - e.g. “Filter(union) by launch date ≤ 14 days and AI coding relevance”.

4. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Sort** stage and final write-out:  
   - e.g. “Sort(filtered) and write result to result.yaml (or final-products.yaml)”.

A minimal example of the TODO list structure you are expected to build is (showing the alternating “record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” steps):

TODO List
- [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
...
- [ ] Union(sources from 1 to 3)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Write result to new-product.json
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

You may have more than 3 QUESTION-based source items (e.g. 7), but the pattern MUST be the same:
first all `Sources(QUESTION i)` items, then one `Union(...)`, one or more `Filter(...)` based on the number of unique products, one `Sort(...)`,
and finally one “write result” item.

You should use this TODO list as the execution plan and mark items as completed as you progress.

After all `Sources(QUESTION i)` tasks are done, you MUST rewrite the TODO list:
- Replace the generic filter items with one `Filter(<product name>)` per discovered product (the count of Filter items must equal the number of products).
- Keep `Sort(filtered)` and the final write step after those filter items.

Example refreshed TODO after finding 3 products:
TODO List
- [ ] Filter(Product Alpha)
- [ ] Filter(Product Beta)
- [ ] Filter(Product Gamma)
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Write result to result.yaml

**Progress logging pattern (few-shot)**
- After EVERY action item, add an explicit “Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” item (and mark it done once you rewrite and overwrite the file).
- This enforces a rhythm of: do a step → record progress → rewrite TODO → update `new-product.json` → next step.
- Sample pattern the model should mirror:
  - [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Union(all source results)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sort(filtered)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Write result to new-product.json
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

**Final output format (what you actually return):**

- Return a **JSON array** of products, sorted from most to least interesting.
- Each entry MUST have the following fields:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "name": "<product name>",
      "url": "<official homepage>",
      "description": "1–3 sentence summary of what this product does, focused on the developer / AI-coding use case.",
      "release_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "category": "<short label, e.g. \"AI IDE\", \"AI coding CLI\", \"code agent\", \"workflow agent\">",
      "sources": ["Product Hunt", "Show HN", "Reddit", "X"],
      "community_quotes": [
        "<short quote from community describing what people like or notice>",
        "<up to 5 quotes total, can be paraphrased but must reflect real feedback>"
      ]
    }
  ]
```

* Only include products that:

  * You have **good evidence** were launched in the last 14 days, and
  * Clearly belong to the **AI coding / developer tools** space.

* If you cannot find any products that satisfy the 14-day constraint,
  return an empty JSON array: `[]`.

Be concise, factual, and avoid marketing fluff. Do **not** include your reasoning text
in the final answer—only the JSON.

**File output + incremental updates requirement**
- Maintain a file named `new-product` in the current working directory.
- After every step (including each “Record progress, rewrite todo”), write the current JSON array to `new-product` (overwrite). Early steps may be partial/rough; later steps should be refined.
- The JSON must always be valid and reflect the best current view (start with `[]` if nothing yet).
- After the final step, ensure `new-product` holds the final sorted array.

## Working Directory Context

Your current working directory is: `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2025-12-28`

All file operations should be relative to this directory.

Below is your QUESTION list. For each QUESTION, treat it as a separate “research lens”
to discover newly launched AI coding products (global constraint: last 14 days).

1. QUESTION 1
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that position themselves as a “full AI IDE” (similar to Windsurf or Cursor), not just a small autocomplete plugin.

2. QUESTION 2
   List newly launched AI coding CLIs or terminal-based agents from the last 14 days that behave like Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, or Claude Code CLI (repo-aware, can run commands, can manage tasks).

3. QUESTION 5
   List newly launched AI tools from the last 14 days that focus on one specific developer workflow (for example debugging, refactoring, test generation, or migration) instead of being a general-purpose coding assistant.

4. QUESTION 7
   List newly launched AI code agents from the last 14 days that advertise “project-long memory” or “workspace memory” across multiple sessions (not just single-chat context).

5. QUESTION 11
   List newly launched open-source AI coding agents from the last 14 days that can be self-hosted or run locally by developers.

6. QUESTION 14
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that integrate directly into existing IDEs (such as VS Code, JetBrains, or Neovim) rather than being a standalone IDE.

7. QUESTION 16
   List newly launched AI agents from the last 14 days that help developers run or orchestrate complex workflows across tools (for example CI/CD, deployment, observability, or incident response), rather than only editing code.

[assistant message #2]
I'll help you discover newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days. Let me start by creating a TODO list to organize this research systematically.

It's described as a full AI IDE where Gemini doesn't just generate code but runs it, tests it, clicks buttons, and fixes its own bugs. It's seen as a direct competitor to Cursor.\n\n2. **Amazon Kiro** - Launched earlier in 2025 (July), described as a \"spec-driven AI IDE\" and \"agentic editor\" designed to rival Cursor and Windsurf.\n\n3. **IBM Project \"Bob\"** - Announced at IBM TechXchange 2025 (October), described as an \"AI-first IDE\" and \"agentic IDE\" that orchestrates multiple LLMs. It's designed as an AI software development partner.\n\n4. **Cursor 2.0** - Released in December 2025, featuring \"Composer,\" a new in-house model.\n\n### Other Notable Alternatives:\n- **Replit** - Full-stack cloud platform with Agent 3\n- **GitHub Copilot** - Ecosystem leader\n- **JetBrains AI**\n- **Zed.dev**\n- **Qodo**\n- **Claude Code**\n\n### Important Context:\n- The search results show that **Windsurf** itself was described as a \"brand-new AI IDE launched in late 2024\" (by Codeium)\n- 2025 has seen rapid proliferation of AI IDEs, with commentators noting \"every day a new AI IDE vscode fork is announced\"\n- Most alternatives focus on **agentic capabilities** - autonomous AI that can write, test, and fix code\n\nUnfortunately, I didn't find a specific, named \"full AI IDE\" that launched **specifically in December 2025** beyond the Cursor 2.0 update. The Google Antigravity IDE appears to be the most significant recent launch (November 2025) that fits your description of a full AI alternative to Cursor and Windsurf.\n\nWould you like me to search for more specific details about any of these tools?\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

      "Based on my search, here's what I found about AI IDEs and alternatives to Cursor and Windsurf:\n\n## Key AI IDEs in the Landscape (Late 2025)\n\n### Major Players Mentioned:\n\n1. **Google Antigravity** - Google's new AI IDE that launched alongside Gemini 3 in November 2025. It's described as a full AI IDE where Gemini doesn't just generate code but runs it, tests it, clicks buttons, and fixes its own bugs. It's seen as a direct competitor to Cursor.\n\n2. **Amazon Kiro** - Launched earlier in 2025 (July), described as a \"spec-driven AI IDE\" and \"agentic editor\" designed to rival Cursor and Windsurf.\n\n3. **IBM Project \"Bob\"** - Announced at IBM TechXchange 2025 (October), described as an \"AI-first IDE\" and \"agentic IDE\" that orchestrates multiple LLMs. It's designed as an AI software development partner.\n\n4. **Cursor 2.0** - Released in December 2025, featuring \"Composer,\" a new in-house model.\n\n### Other Notable Alternatives:\n- **Replit** - Full-stack cloud platform with Agent 3\n- **GitHub Copilot** - Ecosystem leader\n- **JetBrains AI**\n- **Zed.dev**\n- **Qodo**\n- **Claude Code**\n\n### Important Context:\n- The search results show that **Windsurf** itself was described as a \"brand-new AI IDE launched in late 2024\" (by Codeium)\n- 2025 has seen rapid proliferation of AI IDEs, with commentators noting \"every day a new AI IDE vscode fork is announced\"\n- Most alternatives focus on **agentic capabilities** - autonomous AI that can write, test, and fix code\n\nUnfortunately, I didn't find a specific, named \"full AI IDE\" that launched **specifically in December 2025** beyond the Cursor 2.0 update. The Google Antigravity IDE appears to be the most significant recent launch (November 2025) that fits your description of a full AI alternative to Cursor and Windsurf.\n\nWould you like me to search for more specific details about any of these tools?"

[assistant message #89]
Based on my extensive research across all 7 questions, I found very few AI coding tools that were actually **launched in the last 14 days** (December 14-28, 2025). Most results showed tools from earlier in 2025 or general comparison articles.

The only product I found with a clear December 2025 launch date within the 14-day window is:

1. **Toad** (December 18, 2025) - A unified AI terminal tool

I also found:
- **Anthropic Agent Skills** (December 18, 2025) - but this is an open standard/protocol, not a standalone coding product
- Several tools launched in November 2025 (outside the 14-day window)

Let me now compile and verify the final results. Let me search more specifically for Toad to verify its details:

[assistant message #92]
Based on this additional information, Toad was actually announced in **August 2025**, not December 2025. The December coverage was just articles about it, not the actual launch. This means Toad is **outside** the 14-day window.

Let me do one final targeted search for any actual December 14-28, 2025 launches:

[assistant message #104]
Perfect! I found **OpenAI GPT-5.2-Codex** which was announced on **December 18, 2025** - within the 14-day window (December 14-28, 2025). This is the only product I've confirmed that meets both criteria:
1. Launched within the last 14 days (December 18, 2025)
2. Clearly related to AI coding/development

Now let me compile the final results:

**Research Summary:**

After conducting extensive research across 7 different question angles covering full AI IDEs, CLIs, workflow-specific tools, project memory systems, open-source agents, IDE integrations, and workflow orchestration tools, I found that **only one product** definitively meets both criteria:

1. **Launched within the last 14 days** (December 14-28, 2025)
2. **Clearly targets AI coding/developer workflows**

**GPT-5.2-Codex** by OpenAI, announced on December 18, 2025, is the only confirmed launch. Other products I investigated (such as Toad, Agent Skills, or various IDE integrations) were either launched earlier in 2025 or were not standalone coding products but rather protocols/features.

The results have been written to `new-product.json` in the working directory.
