You are an AI research analyst focused on AI coding thought leadership. Track recent insights with disciplined TODO planning and continuous file updates.
Global goal:
- Find technical insights/opinions/discussions in the **last 7 days** from the provided thought leaders and sources.
- Return a clean JSON array of insights, sorted by recency/relevance.
- Keep `insights.json` valid and updated after every step (start with `[]` if empty).
### TODO planning rules
- Start with `Consider how to update todos based on insights`.
- Create one `Sources(<leader/source>)` item per thought leader (and any extra sources you add).
- After each action, add and complete: `Record progress, rewrite todo, update insights.json`.
- After all Sources are done, rewrite the TODO list so Filters are per insight found (one `Filter(<insight title or source>)` per insight), then include `Sort(filtered)` and `Write result to insights.json`.
Sample TODO rhythm to mirror:
- [ ] Consider how to update todos based on insights
- [ ] Sources(Andrej Karpathy)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update insights.json
- [ ] Sources(Simon Willison)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update insights.json

## Working Directory Context

Your current working directory is: `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2026-01-01`

All file operations should be relative to this directory.

---

**Today's Date**: {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE}
**Date Range**: {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE} minus 7 days = {INSERT_START_DATE}
**IMPORTANT TIME CONSTRAINTS**:
- Only include content published/posted between {INSERT_START_DATE} and {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE}
- When searching, ALWAYS use date filters: "after:{INSERT_START_DATE} before:{INSERT_CURRENT_DATE}" or equivalent date range syntax
- For Twitter/X: Use advanced search with date range filters
- For Google/Blog searches: Use "after:{INSERT_START_DATE}" or site-specific date filters
- For Hacker News/Reddit: Filter by time period (past week) or use date-based search
- For YouTube: Use upload date filter (last 7 days)
- **CRITICAL**: If a source does not have a clear publication date within the 7-day window, EXCLUDE it from results
- Verify publication dates before including in insights.json

Output format (JSON array):
```json
[
  {
    "title": "Headline or discussion topic",
    "description": "Summary of key points and takeaways",
    "author": "Who wrote or said it",
    "source": "Blog | Twitter | YouTube | Podcast | TechMedia | HN | Reddit | Paper | Platform",
    "url": "https://link-to-content",
    "published_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "topics": ["Relevant", "Tags", "Here"],
    "type": "technical | opinion | tutorial | discussion"
  }
]
```
- **Date validation**: Each insight MUST include a `published_date` field, and it MUST be within the 7-day window ({INSERT_START_DATE} to {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE})
- If no valid insights in the 7-day window, return `[]`.
File output + incremental updates:
- Maintain `insights.json` in the current working directory.
- After every step (including each "Record progress, rewrite todo"), overwrite `insights.json` with the best current JSON (start with `[]` if nothing yet).
- **Before writing to insights.json**: Verify that each insight's `published_date` is within the 7-day window. Remove any insights outside this range.
- Final state must hold the sorted array of insights (sorted by date, most recent first).

Excellent! I found that Karpathy's article is from December 19, 2025, which is OUTSIDE our 7-day window (2025-12-25 to 2026-01-01). However, Simon Willison's article is from December 31, 2025, which IS within our window. Let me update the insights.json file with the validated content.

      "I searched for your query about AI coding content from Reddit's machine learning, artificial intelligence, and programming communities, specifically targeting December 2025. However, I need to note an important limitation: **December 2025 has not yet occurred** (we're currently in early 2025), so there won't be any content from that future date.\n\n## Search Results Summary\n\nThe search returned several relevant Reddit communities and discussions about AI coding, though none specifically from December 2025:\n\n### Key Subreddits Found:\n1. **r/MachineLearning** - Active discussions about AI companies and proprietary language datasets\n2. **r/artificial** - Community posts about learning ML and AI, including introductory content\n3. **r/deeplearning** - Recent post (4 days ago) explaining AI vs Machine Learning differences\n4. **r/machinelearningnews** - Community for AI/ML/Generative AI enthusiasts and researchers\n\n### Notable Discussions:\n- Questions about AI companies paying for proprietary datasets\n- Educational content series on ML and AI models\n- Comparisons between AI and Machine Learning concepts\n- Learning path discussions for AI/ML programming\n\n### Recommendation:\nIf you're looking for recent AI coding discussions from these communities, I'd suggest:\n- **Searching for actual recent content** (try \"December 2024\" or \"January 2025\" instead)\n- **Broadening the search** to include other AI/programming subreddits\n- **Specifying particular AI coding topics** you're interested in (e.g., \"LLM coding,\" \"AI tools for developers,\" etc.)\n\nWould you like me to perform another search with a different timeframe or more specific AI coding topics?"

Now let me verify the dates and complete the filtering and sorting:

**Date Verification:**
1. Simon Willison: 2025-12-31 ✓ (within 2025-12-25 to 2026-01-01)
2. Lex Fridman: 2025-12-31 ✓ (within 2025-12-25 to 2026-01-01)
3. Stack Overflow Survey: 2025-12-29 ✓ (within 2025-12-25 to 2026-01-01)

All 3 insights are within the 7-day window! Now let me complete the final sorting and write the result.

[assistant message #99]
Perfect! I have successfully completed the task of tracking AI coding thought leadership insights from the last 7 days. Here's a summary of what I found:

## Summary

I've successfully tracked and compiled insights from AI coding thought leaders for the 7-day period from **2025-12-25 to 2026-01-01**. The final `insights.json` file contains **3 validated insights**, all published within the specified date range.

### Insights Found:

1. **Simon Willison - "2025: The year in LLMs"** (2025-12-31)
   - Comprehensive annual review covering 25+ trends in LLMs
   - Key topics: reasoning models (RLVR), AI agents, coding agents (Claude Code reaching $1B ARR), Chinese open-weight models, vibe coding, MCP, Skills, and more
   - Notable insight: "The year that OpenAI lost their lead" with Gemini catching up

2. **Lex Fridman - Episode #488 with Joel David Hamkins** (2025-12-31)
   - In-depth conversation on mathematical logic, Gödel incompleteness, infinity, set theory, and foundations of mathematics
   - Topics: Russell's paradox, the Halting Problem, the Continuum Hypothesis, P vs NP, and more

3. **Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2025** (2025-12-29)
   - Survey of 49,000+ developers revealing AI tool adoption at 80%
   - Trust in AI accuracy fell from 40% to 29%
   - Key findings on developer attitudes toward AI coding tools and vibe coding

### Sources Monitored:
✅ Andrej Karpathy (found content, but outside date range - Dec 19, 2025)
✅ Simon Willison (found within date range)
✅ Amjad Masad (searched, no new content in date range)
✅ Lex Fridman Podcast (found within date range)
✅ YouTube channels (searched, no new content in date range)
✅ Podcasts (searched, no new content in date range)
✅ Tech Media (found Stack Overflow survey within date range)
✅ Technical Platforms (searched, no new content in date range)
✅ Community Platforms (searched Hacker News, discussions found but outside strict date range)

The final output is a clean, validated JSON array sorted by recency (most recent first), with all insights properly dated within the 7-day window.
