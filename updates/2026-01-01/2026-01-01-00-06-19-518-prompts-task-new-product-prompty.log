You are an AI research analyst specialized in AI developer tools:
code agents, AI IDEs, AI coding CLIs, and related devtools.

Your **global goal**:
- Find genuinely new products that have been publicly launched in the **last 14 days**
- AND that clearly target **programming / code / AI dev workflows**
- THEN summarize only the valid ones in a **clean YAML list**.

You MUST treat the questions in the `user:` section as your **research QUESTION list**.
Each QUESTION is a different “angle” on the same market (e.g., full AI IDE, CLI, workflow-focused, etc.).

To organize your reasoning, use this formula:

> Answer = Sort( Filter( Union(Sources) ) )

You must conceptually follow these four stages:

1. **Sources → candidate list (per QUESTION)**
   - For each QUESTION from the `user:` section:
     - Search the web and relevant directories / launch pages.
     - Collect as many **candidate products** as are reasonably relevant.
   - For each candidate, internally track at least:
     - `name` (product name)
     - `url` (official homepage or primary landing page)
     - `description` (1–3 sentences in English summarizing what it does)
     - `sources` (which QUESTION(s) and which site(s) you saw it on)
   - At this stage you are allowed to over-collect; do **not** filter by date yet unless it is trivial.

2. **Union(candidates) → unified candidate set**
   - Merge candidates across all QUESTIONS into a single conceptual set:
     - Deduplicate products that clearly refer to the same thing
       (same URL, or obviously the same product name + branding).
   - After this step you have a unified **candidate pool**:
     - It may still contain old products, or products outside our domain.

3. **Filter(Union) → filtered candidate list**
   - For each product in the unified pool:
     - Investigate its **launch / first public release date** from credible public info
       (official site, launch post, Product Hunt / HN launch, blog, press, etc.).
     - Decide if it satisfies **both**:
       1) Launch date is within the last **14 days** (relative to “today”).
       2) Product is clearly related to **AI coding / code agents / IDE / dev workflows**.
   - If you cannot reasonably verify that the launch is within 14 days,
     **treat it as NOT valid** and exclude it.
   - Internally keep, for each surviving product:
     - `release_date` in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (best reasonable guess)
     - short one-line justification (do not put the justification in final YAML).

4. **Sort(filtered candidates) → final ordered list**
   - Only work with products that passed the filter.
   - Rank them by a simple mental score combining:
     - **recency** (more recent launch date is better),
     - **attention** (strong launch signal: PH upvotes, HN discussion, X/Reddit buzz),
     - **relevance** (how closely it fits “AI coding agent / IDE / devtool”).
   - You do not need to show the numeric score, just use it to order the list.


### Claude Code / todo-style planning requirements

When running inside Claude Code with access to a `todowrite` (or similar TODO-list) tool,
you MUST first externalize this plan as an explicit TODO list **before** doing any research.

Follow these rules:

0. Start with a planning item: add `Consider how to update todos based on products` as the very first TODO.

1. Based on the QUESTION list in the `user:` section, use the `todowrite` tool to create **one TODO item per QUESTION**.  
   - Each item should correspond to “Sources(QUESTION_i)” — i.e., collecting candidates for that QUESTION.

2. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Union** stage:  
   - e.g. “Union(all source results)” to merge candidates from all QUESTION-based source tasks.

3. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Filter** stage:  
   - e.g. “Filter(union) by launch date ≤ 14 days and AI coding relevance”.

4. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Sort** stage and final write-out:  
   - e.g. “Sort(filtered) and write result to result.yaml (or final-products.yaml)”.

A minimal example of the TODO list structure you are expected to build is (showing the alternating “record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” steps):

TODO List
- [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
...
- [ ] Union(sources from 1 to 3)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Write result to new-product.json
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

You may have more than 3 QUESTION-based source items (e.g. 7), but the pattern MUST be the same:
first all `Sources(QUESTION i)` items, then one `Union(...)`, one or more `Filter(...)` based on the number of unique products, one `Sort(...)`,
and finally one “write result” item.

You should use this TODO list as the execution plan and mark items as completed as you progress.

After all `Sources(QUESTION i)` tasks are done, you MUST rewrite the TODO list:
- Replace the generic filter items with one `Filter(<product name>)` per discovered product (the count of Filter items must equal the number of products).
- Keep `Sort(filtered)` and the final write step after those filter items.

Example refreshed TODO after finding 3 products:
TODO List
- [ ] Filter(Product Alpha)
- [ ] Filter(Product Beta)
- [ ] Filter(Product Gamma)
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Write result to result.yaml

**Progress logging pattern (few-shot)**
- After EVERY action item, add an explicit “Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” item (and mark it done once you rewrite and overwrite the file).
- This enforces a rhythm of: do a step → record progress → rewrite TODO → update `new-product.json` → next step.
- Sample pattern the model should mirror:
  - [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Union(all source results)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sort(filtered)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Write result to new-product.json
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

**Final output format (what you actually return):**

- Return a **JSON array** of products, sorted from most to least interesting.
- Each entry MUST have the following fields:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "name": "<product name>",
      "url": "<official homepage>",
      "description": "1–3 sentence summary of what this product does, focused on the developer / AI-coding use case.",
      "release_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "category": "<short label, e.g. \"AI IDE\", \"AI coding CLI\", \"code agent\", \"workflow agent\">",
      "sources": ["Product Hunt", "Show HN", "Reddit", "X"],
      "community_quotes": [
        "<short quote from community describing what people like or notice>",
        "<up to 5 quotes total, can be paraphrased but must reflect real feedback>"
      ]
    }
  ]
```

* Only include products that:

  * You have **good evidence** were launched in the last 14 days, and
  * Clearly belong to the **AI coding / developer tools** space.

* If you cannot find any products that satisfy the 14-day constraint,
  return an empty JSON array: `[]`.

Be concise, factual, and avoid marketing fluff. Do **not** include your reasoning text
in the final answer—only the JSON.

**File output + incremental updates requirement**
- Maintain a file named `new-product` in the current working directory.
- After every step (including each “Record progress, rewrite todo”), write the current JSON array to `new-product` (overwrite). Early steps may be partial/rough; later steps should be refined.
- The JSON must always be valid and reflect the best current view (start with `[]` if nothing yet).
- After the final step, ensure `new-product` holds the final sorted array.

## Working Directory Context

Your current working directory is: `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2026-01-01`

All file operations should be relative to this directory.

---

Below is your QUESTION list. For each QUESTION, treat it as a separate “research lens”
to discover newly launched AI coding products (global constraint: last 14 days).

1. QUESTION 1
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that position themselves as a “full AI IDE” (similar to Windsurf or Cursor), not just a small autocomplete plugin.

2. QUESTION 2
   List newly launched AI coding CLIs or terminal-based agents from the last 14 days that behave like Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, or Claude Code CLI (repo-aware, can run commands, can manage tasks).

3. QUESTION 5
   List newly launched AI tools from the last 14 days that focus on one specific developer workflow (for example debugging, refactoring, test generation, or migration) instead of being a general-purpose coding assistant.

4. QUESTION 7
   List newly launched AI code agents from the last 14 days that advertise “project-long memory” or “workspace memory” across multiple sessions (not just single-chat context).

5. QUESTION 11
   List newly launched open-source AI coding agents from the last 14 days that can be self-hosted or run locally by developers.

6. QUESTION 14
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that integrate directly into existing IDEs (such as VS Code, JetBrains, or Neovim) rather than being a standalone IDE.

7. QUESTION 16
   List newly launched AI agents from the last 14 days that help developers run or orchestrate complex workflows across tools (for example CI/CD, deployment, observability, or incident response), rather than only editing code.

[assistant message #2]
I'll help you research newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days. Let me start by creating a structured TODO list and then systematically work through each question.

[assistant message #30]
I notice from the searches that the current working directory is dated `2026-01-01` which suggests I'm looking for products launched between approximately December 18, 2025 and January 1, 2026. However, my searches haven't revealed many concrete new launches in this exact 14-day window. Let me now move to the other questions while collecting potential candidates, and then we'll filter carefully by exact launch dates.

Let me update the file with current findings and continue with QUESTION 2:

[assistant message #136]
Based on the date of 2026-01-01 in the working directory, the "last 14 days" would be December 18, 2025 to January 1, 2026. Let me filter the candidates:

Looking at my collected products, I need to verify which ones were actually launched between December 18-31, 2025:

**Products WITHIN the 14-day window (Dec 18-31, 2025):**
1. **Toad** - Dec 22, 2025 ✓
2. **Mysti** - Dec 28, 2025 ✓  
3. **Visual Studio 2026** - Dec 18, 2025 ✓
4. **Agentic.nvim** - Dec 20, 2025 ✓
5. **AI Agent Skills (Next.js 16)** - Dec 20, 2025 ✓

**Products OUTSIDE the 14-day window (before Dec 18, 2025):**
- Aspire 13.1 (Dec 17)
- LangSmith Fetch Skill (Dec 15)
- Mistral Devstral 2 (Dec 9)
- Cursor Visual Editor (Dec 11)
- Claude Code for Slack (Dec 8)

The key innovation is that it allows different AI models (Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, and Google Gemini) to **debate, challenge each other, and synthesize** solutions together.\n\n### Key Features:\n- **Multi-agent collaboration**: You can select any two AI agents to work together\n- **Debate mode**: Agents discuss and debate approaches before synthesizing a solution\n- **\"Dream team\" approach**: Like having a senior developer and tech lead review your code simultaneously\n\n## Hacker News Discussion (December 2025)\n\nThe project was featured on Hacker News with a \"Show HN\" post titled **\"Mysti – Claude, Codex, and Gemini debate your code, then synthesize\"**.\n\n**Key points from the HN discussion:**\n\n1. **Creator's motivation**: Baha (the creator) explained they pay for Claude Pro, ChatGPT Plus, and Gemini but could only use one at a time - Mysti solves this by allowing collaboration between them\n\n2. **Community concerns**:\n   - **Licensing model**: Some users were concerned about the BSL (Business Source License) licensing approach, especially given the rapidly changing AI landscape\n   - **Website issues**: The DeepMyst.com site was reported as 404'ing initially\n\n3. **Positive reception**: Many users found the concept of having multiple AI agents debate architecture decisions appealing - like \"locking Claude and Gemini in a room until they agree on the best architecture\"\n\n## December 2025 Context\n\nThe extension was actively updated in December 2025, with the changelog showing version 0.2.0 released in December 2025. It's part of the broader trend of **agentic AI coding tools** that emerged strongly in 2025.\n\n## Community Feedback\n\nFrom various developer communities:\n- **Concept**: Well-received as an innovative approach to AI-assisted coding\n- **Practicality**: Seen as useful for tricky architecture decisions where a \"second opinion\" is valuable\n- **Maturity**: Some noted it \"needs some work\" but represents an interesting direction for AI coding tools\n\nThe extension is available on the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DeepMyst.mysti) and [GitHub](https://github.com/DeepMyst/Mysti).\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

      "Based on my search, here's what I found about **Mysti by DeepMyst** and the community discussions from December 2025:\n\n## What is Mysti?\n\nMysti is a **VS Code extension** created by DeepMyst that enables multiple AI coding agents to collaborate on your code. The key innovation is that it allows different AI models (Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, and Google Gemini) to **debate, challenge each other, and synthesize** solutions together.\n\n### Key Features:\n- **Multi-agent collaboration**: You can select any two AI agents to work together\n- **Debate mode**: Agents discuss and debate approaches before synthesizing a solution\n- **\"Dream team\" approach**: Like having a senior developer and tech lead review your code simultaneously\n\n## Hacker News Discussion (December 2025)\n\nThe project was featured on Hacker News with a \"Show HN\" post titled **\"Mysti – Claude, Codex, and Gemini debate your code, then synthesize\"**.\n\n**Key points from the HN discussion:**\n\n1. **Creator's motivation**: Baha (the creator) explained they pay for Claude Pro, ChatGPT Plus, and Gemini but could only use one at a time - Mysti solves this by allowing collaboration between them\n\n2. **Community concerns**:\n   - **Licensing model**: Some users were concerned about the BSL (Business Source License) licensing approach, especially given the rapidly changing AI landscape\n   - **Website issues**: The DeepMyst.com site was reported as 404'ing initially\n\n3. **Positive reception**: Many users found the concept of having multiple AI agents debate architecture decisions appealing - like \"locking Claude and Gemini in a room until they agree on the best architecture\"\n\n## December 2025 Context\n\nThe extension was actively updated in December 2025, with the changelog showing version 0.2.0 released in December 2025. It's part of the broader trend of **agentic AI coding tools** that emerged strongly in 2025.\n\n## Community Feedback\n\nFrom various developer communities:\n- **Concept**: Well-received as an innovative approach to AI-assisted coding\n- **Practicality**: Seen as useful for tricky architecture decisions where a \"second opinion\" is valuable\n- **Maturity**: Some noted it \"needs some work\" but represents an interesting direction for AI coding tools\n\nThe extension is available on the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DeepMyst.mysti) and [GitHub](https://github.com/DeepMyst/Mysti)."

It's described as a \"bring your own agent\" coding CLI.\n\n## Related Links\n\n**GitHub Repository:**\n- https://github.com/batrachianai/toad - The project provides a unified interface for AI in your terminal, running coding agents seamlessly under a single terminal UI using the ACP protocol.\n\n**Other Coverage:**\n- **Ben's Bites**: Also covered the Show HN post\n- **InfoQ**: Published an article on December 22, 2025, about Toad being a \"Unified CLI Tool for All Your LLMs\"\n- **Daily.dev**: Described Toad as \"a new terminal UI that provides a unified interface for multiple AI coding agents (OpenHands, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, etc.)\"\n\n**Background:**\nThe project appears to be by Will McGugan (who also wrote about it back in July 2025), designed to provide a consistent, beautiful terminal interface for working with various AI coding agents that typically have fragmented user interfaces.\n\nYou can view the full Hacker News comments thread at the first link above."

[assistant message #163]
Excellent! Now let me compile the final sorted list. Based on the research, here's my ranking by recency, attention (launch signals), and relevance:

1. **Mysti** (Dec 28) - Most recent, unique multi-agent debate concept, strong HN discussion
2. **Agentic.nvim** (Dec 20) - Open-source, novel ACP implementation, active community
3. **AI Agent Skills** (Dec 20) - Framework for agent development, open-source
4. **Toad** (Dec 22) - Strong UX focus, addresses real pain point, InfoQ coverage
5. **Visual Studio 2026** (Dec 18) - Major release, though more incremental than revolutionary
