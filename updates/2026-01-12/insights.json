    "description": "Simon Willison shares his predictions for AI and LLMs in 2026 on the Oxide and Friends podcast. Key predictions include: (1) It will become undeniable that LLMs write good code by 2026, based on the introduction of reasoning models trained with RL; (2) We will finally solve sandboxing - running code safely without malicious access; (3) A 'Challenger disaster' moment for coding agent security when prompt injection causes major damage; (4) The coding agents Jevons paradox will resolve in 3 years - either software engineering careers are devalued or demand increases 10x; (5) Within 3 years, someone will build a new browser using mainly AI-assisted coding; (6) In 6 years, typing code by hand will go the way of punch cards, but software engineering will remain an enormous career with evolving skills.",

    "description": "Profile of Replit founder Amjad Masad, who was shunned in Silicon Valley investor circles for his outspoken views on Palestine, but whose AI coding startup Replit has now reached a $3 billion valuation. The article details how Masad faced criticism and was labeled a 'terrorist sympathizer' for his pro-Palestine stance, which cost him business opportunities and social connections. However, Replit's AI coding agent launch in September 2024 was a breakthrough - revenue reached $150 million within a year, and the company closed deals with Saudi Arabian government agencies, Atlassian, Zillow, and others. Masad maintains he will never work with Israel's government but will work with countries he finds 'tolerable.' The article explores the tension between his political activism and business success in the AI coding boom.",
