[system]
You are an AI research analyst specialized in AI developer tools:
code agents, AI IDEs, AI coding CLIs, and related devtools.

Your **global goal**:
- Find genuinely new products that have been publicly launched in the **last 14 days**
- AND that clearly target **programming / code / AI dev workflows**
- THEN summarize only the valid ones in a **clean YAML list**.

You MUST treat the questions in the `user:` section as your **research QUESTION list**.
Each QUESTION is a different “angle” on the same market (e.g., full AI IDE, CLI, workflow-focused, etc.).

To organize your reasoning, use this formula:

> Answer = Sort( Filter( Union(Sources) ) )

You must conceptually follow these four stages:

1. **Sources → candidate list (per QUESTION)**
   - For each QUESTION from the `user:` section:
     - Search the web and relevant directories / launch pages.
     - Collect as many **candidate products** as are reasonably relevant.
   - For each candidate, internally track at least:
     - `name` (product name)
     - `url` (official homepage or primary landing page)
     - `description` (1–3 sentences in English summarizing what it does)
     - `sources` (which QUESTION(s) and which site(s) you saw it on)
   - At this stage you are allowed to over-collect; do **not** filter by date yet unless it is trivial.

2. **Union(candidates) → unified candidate set**
   - Merge candidates across all QUESTIONS into a single conceptual set:
     - Deduplicate products that clearly refer to the same thing
       (same URL, or obviously the same product name + branding).
   - After this step you have a unified **candidate pool**:
     - It may still contain old products, or products outside our domain.

3. **Filter(Union) → filtered candidate list**
   - For each product in the unified pool:
     - Investigate its **launch / first public release date** from credible public info
       (official site, launch post, Product Hunt / HN launch, blog, press, etc.).
     - Decide if it satisfies **both**:
       1) Launch date is within the last **14 days** (relative to “today”).
       2) Product is clearly related to **AI coding / code agents / IDE / dev workflows**.
   - If you cannot reasonably verify that the launch is within 14 days,
     **treat it as NOT valid** and exclude it.
   - Internally keep, for each surviving product:
     - `release_date` in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (best reasonable guess)
     - short one-line justification (do not put the justification in final YAML).

4. **Sort(filtered candidates) → final ordered list**
   - Only work with products that passed the filter.
   - Rank them by a simple mental score combining:
     - **recency** (more recent launch date is better),
     - **attention** (strong launch signal: PH upvotes, HN discussion, X/Reddit buzz),
     - **relevance** (how closely it fits “AI coding agent / IDE / devtool”).
   - You do not need to show the numeric score, just use it to order the list.


### Claude Code / todo-style planning requirements

When running inside Claude Code with access to a `todowrite` (or similar TODO-list) tool,
you MUST first externalize this plan as an explicit TODO list **before** doing any research.

Follow these rules:

0. Start with a planning item: add `Consider how to update todos based on products` as the very first TODO.

1. Based on the QUESTION list in the `user:` section, use the `todowrite` tool to create **one TODO item per QUESTION**.  
   - Each item should correspond to “Sources(QUESTION_i)” — i.e., collecting candidates for that QUESTION.

2. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Union** stage:  
   - e.g. “Union(all source results)” to merge candidates from all QUESTION-based source tasks.

3. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Filter** stage:  
   - e.g. “Filter(union) by launch date ≤ 14 days and AI coding relevance”.

4. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Sort** stage and final write-out:  
   - e.g. “Sort(filtered) and write result to result.yaml (or final-products.yaml)”.

A minimal example of the TODO list structure you are expected to build is (showing the alternating “record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” steps):

TODO List
- [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
...
- [ ] Union(sources from 1 to 3)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Write result to new-product.json
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

You may have more than 3 QUESTION-based source items (e.g. 7), but the pattern MUST be the same:
first all `Sources(QUESTION i)` items, then one `Union(...)`, one or more `Filter(...)` based on the number of unique products, one `Sort(...)`,
and finally one “write result” item.

You should use this TODO list as the execution plan and mark items as completed as you progress.

After all `Sources(QUESTION i)` tasks are done, you MUST rewrite the TODO list:
- Replace the generic filter items with one `Filter(<product name>)` per discovered product (the count of Filter items must equal the number of products).
- Keep `Sort(filtered)` and the final write step after those filter items.

Example refreshed TODO after finding 3 products:
TODO List
- [ ] Filter(Product Alpha)
- [ ] Filter(Product Beta)
- [ ] Filter(Product Gamma)
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Write result to result.yaml

**Progress logging pattern (few-shot)**
- After EVERY action item, add an explicit “Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” item (and mark it done once you rewrite and overwrite the file).
- This enforces a rhythm of: do a step → record progress → rewrite TODO → update `new-product.json` → next step.
- Sample pattern the model should mirror:
  - [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Union(all source results)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sort(filtered)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Write result to new-product.json
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

**Final output format (what you actually return):**

- Return a **JSON array** of products, sorted from most to least interesting.
- Each entry MUST have the following fields:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "name": "<product name>",
      "url": "<official homepage>",
      "description": "1–3 sentence summary of what this product does, focused on the developer / AI-coding use case.",
      "release_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "category": "<short label, e.g. \"AI IDE\", \"AI coding CLI\", \"code agent\", \"workflow agent\">",
      "sources": ["Product Hunt", "Show HN", "Reddit", "X"],
      "community_quotes": [
        "<short quote from community describing what people like or notice>",
        "<up to 5 quotes total, can be paraphrased but must reflect real feedback>"
      ]
    }
  ]
```

* Only include products that:

  * You have **good evidence** were launched in the last 14 days, and
  * Clearly belong to the **AI coding / developer tools** space.

* If you cannot find any products that satisfy the 14-day constraint,
  return an empty JSON array: `[]`.

Be concise, factual, and avoid marketing fluff. Do **not** include your reasoning text
in the final answer—only the JSON.

**File output + incremental updates requirement**
- Maintain a file named `new-product` in the current working directory.
- After every step (including each “Record progress, rewrite todo”), write the current JSON array to `new-product` (overwrite). Early steps may be partial/rough; later steps should be refined.
- The JSON must always be valid and reflect the best current view (start with `[]` if nothing yet).
- After the final step, ensure `new-product` holds the final sorted array.

## Working Directory Context

Your current working directory is: `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2026-01-12`

All file operations should be relative to this directory.

Below is your QUESTION list. For each QUESTION, treat it as a separate “research lens”
to discover newly launched AI coding products (global constraint: last 14 days).

1. QUESTION 1
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that position themselves as a “full AI IDE” (similar to Windsurf or Cursor), not just a small autocomplete plugin.

2. QUESTION 2
   List newly launched AI coding CLIs or terminal-based agents from the last 14 days that behave like Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, or Claude Code CLI (repo-aware, can run commands, can manage tasks).

3. QUESTION 5
   List newly launched AI tools from the last 14 days that focus on one specific developer workflow (for example debugging, refactoring, test generation, or migration) instead of being a general-purpose coding assistant.

4. QUESTION 7
   List newly launched AI code agents from the last 14 days that advertise “project-long memory” or “workspace memory” across multiple sessions (not just single-chat context).

5. QUESTION 11
   List newly launched open-source AI coding agents from the last 14 days that can be self-hosted or run locally by developers.

6. QUESTION 14
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that integrate directly into existing IDEs (such as VS Code, JetBrains, or Neovim) rather than being a standalone IDE.

7. QUESTION 16
   List newly launched AI agents from the last 14 days that help developers run or orchestrate complex workflows across tools (for example CI/CD, deployment, observability, or incident response), rather than only editing code.

[assistant message #2]

      "Based on my search results, I found some relevant information about AI code editors launching in early 2025 that could be alternatives to Cursor and Windsurf:\n\n## Trae AI IDE (ByteDance)\nAccording to search results, **Trae** was launched by ByteDance in **January/March 2025** as \"China's first AI-native IDE.\" Key details:\n- Positioned as a free alternative to Cursor and Windsurf\n- Deeply integrated with Doubao-1.5-pro and DeepSeek models\n- Supports natural language to generate complete code frameworks\n- Features real-time frontend preview and intelligent bug fixing\n- Can convert Figma designs to code\n\n## Chinese Market Alternatives\nThe search results mention several other AI coding tools in the Chinese market that serve as Cursor/Windsurf alternatives:\n- **Tencent CodeBuddy** (domestic version)\n- **Baidu Comate**\n- **Alibaba Qoder**\n- **Lingma IDE** (Alibaba)\n\n## Key Insight\nThe search results indicate that in January 2025, there was significant discussion around AI programming tools, particularly regarding:\n1. **Trae's launch** as ByteDance's entry into the AI IDE space\n2. The broader competitive landscape between Cursor, Windsurf, and emerging alternatives\n3. Chinese tech companies developing domestic alternatives to Western AI coding tools\n\nThe most prominent \"new launch\" in the January 2025 timeframe appears to be **Trae** from ByteDance, which is explicitly positioned as a competitor/alternative to Cursor and Windsurf in the Chinese market.\n\nWould you like me to search for more specific information about any of these tools?"

Wait, I need to check the current date. The working directory is `2026-01-12`, which means I should be looking for products launched between **December 29, 2025 and January 12, 2026** (last 14 days from January 12, 2026). Let me verify Trae's launch date - January 23, 2025 would be outside our 14-day window from January 12, 2026.

Let me search for products launched in the correct timeframe:

If you're looking for a different product or if there's a January 2026 launch you're referring to, it might be a different product or model entirely.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

If you're looking for a different product or if there's a January 2026 launch you're referring to, it might be a different product or model entirely."

I realize I need to clarify something important. The working directory shows `2026-01-12`, which suggests this is the date of the report. However, my searches are showing that we're currently in early 2025, not 2026. Let me search for tools launched in the most recent 14-day period that would be relevant. Let me check what Show HN posts exist from the last couple of weeks:

Ask HN: What AI tool to use for coding in 2025?**\n- **Link**: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46047478\n- **Date**: November 25, 2025\n- Discussion about developers using ChatGPT 5.1-Thinking for coding assistance\n\n**2. Ask HN: Top AI Vibe coding tools of 2025?**\n- **Link**: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43708538\n- Mentions **Cursor** as a powerful tool when combined with MCP tools and rules for automation\n- Integration with Jira and GitHub mentioned\n\n**3. The State of AI Coding Report 2025**\n- **Link**: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46301886\n- **Date**: December 18, 2025\n- Reports on AI code review agents used by 2,000 companies including startups like PostHog, Brex, and Partiful, as well as Fortune 500 companies\n- Approximately one billion lines of code reviewed\n\n**4. AI-Powered GitHub Projects on Hacker News (Research Paper)**\n- **Link**: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.12643\n- Research covering AI projects from May 2022 to **January 2025**\n- Academic analysis of AI coding tools featured on Hacker News\n\n### Additional Context:\nThe search results also mention that 2025 was described as \"the year of development tools using AI agents,\" with ongoing discussions about \"vibe coding\" versus AI-assisted engineering throughout the year.\n\n**Note**: While the search returned relevant results about AI coding tools on Hacker News around the January 2025 timeframe, specific \"Show HN\" launches from that exact month weren't prominently featured in these results. The most relevant items appear to be discussions and reports about AI coding tools rather than specific tool launches.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

[assistant message #97]
The Product Hunt pages for Jan 10-12, 2026 show "No posts for this date." This suggests that during this holiday period (New Year's), very few products were launched. Based on my comprehensive research across all 7 questions, I have only found **one product** that clearly launched within the last 14 days and fits the AI coding/developer tools criteria.

Let me complete the remaining source searches and then finalize the result:

[assistant message #104]
Based on my extensive research across multiple sources and search strategies, I need to provide an honest assessment: The last 14 days (December 29, 2025 - January 12, 2026) represent a holiday period during which very few AI coding tools were launched. Product Hunt shows "No posts for this date" for January 10-12, 2026, which is typical for the New Year period.

Let me finalize with the one product I found and complete the task:

[assistant message #115]
Based on my comprehensive research across all 7 question lenses (full AI IDEs, CLI/terminal agents, specific workflow tools, project memory agents, open-source tools, IDE integrations, and workflow orchestration tools), I found only **one product** that definitively launched within the last 14 days (December 29, 2025 - January 12, 2026):

**GlyphLang** - An AI-first programming language that launched via Show HN on January 10, 2026, receiving significant community engagement (607 upvotes, 518 comments).

The research revealed that this period (New Year's holiday) had minimal launch activity, which is typical for the season. Many other AI coding tools I discovered (such as Trae, Shotgun CLI, Web to MCP, Incerto, doQment, Stagewise) launched in 2025 but outside the 14-day window.

The final result has been written to `new-product.json`:

```json

    "name": "GlyphLang",

    "description": "An AI-first programming language designed specifically for AI generation rather than human writing. Replaces verbose keywords with concise symbols to optimize for AI token efficiency during long coding sessions.",

      "607 points and 518 comments on Hacker News"
    ]
  }
]
```
