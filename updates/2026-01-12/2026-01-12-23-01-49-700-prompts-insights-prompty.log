[system]
You are an AI research analyst focused on AI coding thought leadership. Track recent insights with disciplined TODO planning and continuous file updates.
Global goal:
- Find technical insights/opinions/discussions in the **last 7 days** from the provided thought leaders and sources.
- Return a clean JSON array of insights, sorted by recency/relevance.
- Keep `insights.json` valid and updated after every step (start with `[]` if empty).
### TODO planning rules
- Start with `Consider how to update todos based on insights`.
- Create one `Sources(<leader/source>)` item per thought leader (and any extra sources you add).
- After each action, add and complete: `Record progress, rewrite todo, update insights.json`.
- After all Sources are done, rewrite the TODO list so Filters are per insight found (one `Filter(<insight title or source>)` per insight), then include `Sort(filtered)` and `Write result to insights.json`.
Sample TODO rhythm to mirror:
- [ ] Consider how to update todos based on insights
- [ ] Sources(Andrej Karpathy)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update insights.json
- [ ] Sources(Simon Willison)

## Working Directory Context

Your current working directory is: `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2026-01-12`

All file operations should be relative to this directory.

---

**Today's Date**: {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE}
**Date Range**: {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE} minus 7 days = {INSERT_START_DATE}
**IMPORTANT TIME CONSTRAINTS**:
- Only include content published/posted between {INSERT_START_DATE} and {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE}
- When searching, ALWAYS use date filters: "after:{INSERT_START_DATE} before:{INSERT_CURRENT_DATE}" or equivalent date range syntax
- For Twitter/X: Use advanced search with date range filters
- For Google/Blog searches: Use "after:{INSERT_START_DATE}" or site-specific date filters
- For Hacker News/Reddit: Filter by time period (past week) or use date-based search
- For YouTube: Use upload date filter (last 7 days)
- **CRITICAL**: If a source does not have a clear publication date within the 7-day window, EXCLUDE it from results
- Verify publication dates before including in insights.json

Output format (JSON array):
```json
[
  {
    "title": "Headline or discussion topic",
    "description": "Summary of key points and takeaways",
    "author": "Who wrote or said it",
    "source": "Blog | Twitter | YouTube | Podcast | TechMedia | HN | Reddit | Paper | Platform",
    "url": "https://link-to-content",
    "published_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "topics": ["Relevant", "Tags", "Here"],
    "type": "technical | opinion | tutorial | discussion"
  }
]
```
- **Date validation**: Each insight MUST include a `published_date` field, and it MUST be within the 7-day window ({INSERT_START_DATE} to {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE})
- If no valid insights in the 7-day window, return `[]`.
File output + incremental updates:
- Maintain `insights.json` in the current working directory.
- After every step (including each "Record progress, rewrite todo"), overwrite `insights.json` with the best current JSON (start with `[]` if nothing yet).
- **Before writing to insights.json**: Verify that each insight's `published_date` is within the 7-day window. Remove any insights outside this range.
- Final state must hold the sorted array of insights (sorted by date, most recent first).

Here are the key findings:\n\n## Recent Content from Andrej Karpathy (January 2026)\n\n### 1. **\"State of LLMs Heading into 2026\"**\n- A wrap-up post on the state of LLMs as we head into 2026 has been circulating, with Karpathy being credited as a source (h/t @karpathy)\n- [Source: Twitter/X post from @aiedge_](https://x.com/aiedge_/status/2004326305840701945)\n\n### 2. **Notable Recent Tweet - \"Feeling Behind\"**\nKarpathy posted a tweet that gained significant attention where he stated that **\"he has never felt this behind\"** in terms of adopting AI. This sentiment was particularly striking coming from:\n- A founding member of OpenAI\n- Former Director of AI at Tesla\n- Stanford CS231n course creator\n\nThis tweet resonated widely in the tech community, with many noting that if someone of Karpathy's stature feels behind, it highlights how rapidly AI is evolving.\n\n### 3. **AI Changing Development**\nRecent discussions around Karpathy's posts highlight that:\n- AI is fundamentally changing what day-to-day job looks like\n- Machines are writing more code while humans write less\n- He emphasizes thinking of LLMs not as entities but as **\"simulators\"**\n\n### 4. **\"Vibe Coding\" Concept**\nKarpathy recently coined the term **\"Vibe Coding\"** to describe how advanced LLMs are changing development - where developers increasingly \"give in to\" the AI's capabilities rather than writing everything manually.\n\n### 5. **Recent Interviews**\nHe appears in the Dwarkesh Podcast discussing:\n- AGI timeline (still a decade away in his view)\n- Why reinforcement learning is \"terrible (but everything else is much worse)\"\n- Model collapse and how it prevents LLMs from learning the way humans do\n\n## Follow Karpathy\nYou can follow his official account: [@karpathy on X/Twitter](https://x.com/karpathy), where he's currently building @EurekaLabsAI and continues to share insights on training large deep neural networks.\n\nWould you like me to search for more specific details about any of these topics?\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

Here are the key findings:\n\n## Recent Content from Andrej Karpathy (January 2026)\n\n### 1. **\"State of LLMs Heading into 2026\"**\n- A wrap-up post on the state of LLMs as we head into 2026 has been circulating, with Karpathy being credited as a source (h/t @karpathy)\n- [Source: Twitter/X post from @aiedge_](https://x.com/aiedge_/status/2004326305840701945)\n\n### 2. **Notable Recent Tweet - \"Feeling Behind\"**\nKarpathy posted a tweet that gained significant attention where he stated that **\"he has never felt this behind\"** in terms of adopting AI. This sentiment was particularly striking coming from:\n- A founding member of OpenAI\n- Former Director of AI at Tesla\n- Stanford CS231n course creator\n\nThis tweet resonated widely in the tech community, with many noting that if someone of Karpathy's stature feels behind, it highlights how rapidly AI is evolving.\n\n### 3. **AI Changing Development**\nRecent discussions around Karpathy's posts highlight that:\n- AI is fundamentally changing what day-to-day job looks like\n- Machines are writing more code while humans write less\n- He emphasizes thinking of LLMs not as entities but as **\"simulators\"**\n\n### 4. **\"Vibe Coding\" Concept**\nKarpathy recently coined the term **\"Vibe Coding\"** to describe how advanced LLMs are changing development - where developers increasingly \"give in to\" the AI's capabilities rather than writing everything manually.\n\n### 5. **Recent Interviews**\nHe appears in the Dwarkesh Podcast discussing:\n- AGI timeline (still a decade away in his view)\n- Why reinforcement learning is \"terrible (but everything else is much worse)\"\n- Model collapse and how it prevents LLMs from learning the way humans do\n\n## Follow Karpathy\nYou can follow his official account: [@karpathy on X/Twitter](https://x.com/karpathy), where he's currently building @EurekaLabsAI and continues to share insights on training large deep neural networks.\n\nWould you like me to search for more specific details about any of these topics?"

However, here's what I found relevant to your search query:\n\n## Recent Developments\n\n**Lex Fridman is planning new AI podcast content:**\n- He posted on LinkedIn and X (Twitter) about \"doing a long, super-technical podcast on the state-of-the-art in AI\" and requested question and topic suggestions from his audience\n- The content will cover \"everything from details of LLM...\" suggesting a focus on Large Language Models\n\n## Relevant Existing Content\n\n**AI Coding and LLMs:**\n- There's mention of a podcast with the **Cursor team** on AI-assisted coding (from approximately 1 year ago)\n- His podcast regularly covers topics like:\n  - Deep learning and AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)\n  - Robotics and AI\n  - Technical discussions about LLMs and their limitations\n  - State-of-the-art AI research\n\n## Resources\n\n- **Official Website**: [lexfridman.com/podcast/](https://lexfridman.com/podcast/)\n- **Apple Podcasts**: Available for subscription\n- **YouTube**: Features past episodes, including discussions with Yann LeCun about Meta AI, Open Source, and limits of LLMs\n\n**Note**: Since January 2026 is in the future, there likely aren't any episodes from that time period yet. I'd recommend checking Lex Fridman's official channels (website, YouTube, LinkedIn, X) for announcements about upcoming episodes related to AI, LLMs, coding, and machine learning."

However, I found several recent and highly relevant articles from 2024-2025 about AI coding trends:\n\n### Recent AI Coding & Development Articles:\n\n1. **[AI coding tools are shifting to a surprising place: The terminal](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/15/ai-coding-tools-are-shifting-to-a-surprising-place-the-terminal/)** *(July 15, 2025)*\n   - Discusses how AI coding tools are moving beyond traditional code editors\n\n2. **[How Google's dev tools manager makes AI coding work](https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/23/how-googles-dev-tools-manager-makes-ai-coding-work/)** *(September 23, 2025)*\n   - Features Google PM Ryan Salva on tools like Gemini CLI and how AI is changing software development\n\n3. **[A quarter of startups in YC's current cohort have codebases that are almost entirely AI-generated](https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/06/a-quarter-of-startups-in-ycs-current-cohort-have-codebases-that-are-almost-entirely-ai-generated/)** *(March 6, 2025)*\n   - Reports that 25% of YC's W25 batch have 95% of their codebases generated by AI\n\n4. **[Vibe coding has turned senior devs into 'AI babysitters,' but they say it's worth it](https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/14/vibe-coding-has-turned-senior-devs-into-ai-babysitters-but-they-say-its-worth-it/)** *(September 14, 2025)*\n   - Explores how experienced developers are adapting to AI-generated code\n\n### Additional Context:\n- The search also found articles from 2024 about AI coding assistants helping startups develop products\n- Articles about open source LLMs being preferred over OpenAI for code testing\n- Information about code-generating models like StarCoder 2\n\n**Note**: Since we're currently in early 2025, it's possible that articles making predictions or discussing developments for 2026 haven't been published yet, or TechCrunch may not have covered AI coding tools specifically in the context of 2026.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

However, Replit's AI coding agent launch in September 2024 was a breakthrough - revenue reached $150 million within a year, and the company closed deals with Saudi Arabian government agencies, Atlassian, Zillow, and others.
