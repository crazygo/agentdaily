    "description": "Thoughtworks retreat findings challenge narrative that AI eliminates need for junior developers. Key insights: 1) Juniors are more profitable than ever as AI tools get them past net-negative phase faster, 2) Juniors are better at AI tools than senior engineers, having never developed habits that slow adoption, 3) Real concern is mid-level engineers who may lack fundamentals needed to thrive in new environment, 4) Retraining mid-level engineers is genuinely difficult and no organization has solved it yet.",

AI introduced a new rhythm where workers manage multiple active threads simultaneously: manually writing code while AI generates alternatives, running multiple agents in parallel, or reviving deferred tasks. This creates cognitive load and a sense of always juggling, even as work feels productive. The study calls for organizations to build an 'AI practice' to structure AI usage and avoid burnout.",
