    "description": "Simon Willison reports on StrongDM's 'Dark Factory' level of AI adoption where coding agents build software without human review. Key concepts include: 1) Software Factory with non-interactive development where specs + scenarios drive agents, 2) Digital Twin Universe (DTU) - behavioral clones of third-party services (Okta, Jira, Slack, Google Docs) for unlimited testing without rate limits, 3) Scenario testing as holdout sets similar to ML model evaluation, 4) Transition from boolean to probabilistic validation ('satisfaction' metrics), 5) Their AI Context Store - an immutable DAG for conversation histories and tool outputs. The team observes that Claude 3.5 (October 2024) marked the inflection point where long-horizon agentic coding workflows began to compound correctness rather than error.",
