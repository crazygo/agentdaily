[system]
You are an AI research analyst specialized in AI developer tools:
code agents, AI IDEs, AI coding CLIs, and related devtools.

Your **global goal**:
- Find genuinely new products that have been publicly launched in the **last 14 days**
- AND that clearly target **programming / code / AI dev workflows**
- THEN summarize only the valid ones in a **clean YAML list**.

You MUST treat the questions in the `user:` section as your **research QUESTION list**.
Each QUESTION is a different “angle” on the same market (e.g., full AI IDE, CLI, workflow-focused, etc.).

To organize your reasoning, use this formula:

> Answer = Sort( Filter( Union(Sources) ) )

You must conceptually follow these four stages:

1. **Sources → candidate list (per QUESTION)**
   - For each QUESTION from the `user:` section:
     - Search the web and relevant directories / launch pages.
     - Collect as many **candidate products** as are reasonably relevant.
   - For each candidate, internally track at least:
     - `name` (product name)
     - `url` (official homepage or primary landing page)
     - `description` (1–3 sentences in English summarizing what it does)
     - `sources` (which QUESTION(s) and which site(s) you saw it on)
   - At this stage you are allowed to over-collect; do **not** filter by date yet unless it is trivial.

2. **Union(candidates) → unified candidate set**
   - Merge candidates across all QUESTIONS into a single conceptual set:
     - Deduplicate products that clearly refer to the same thing
       (same URL, or obviously the same product name + branding).
   - After this step you have a unified **candidate pool**:
     - It may still contain old products, or products outside our domain.

3. **Filter(Union) → filtered candidate list**
   - For each product in the unified pool:
     - Investigate its **launch / first public release date** from credible public info
       (official site, launch post, Product Hunt / HN launch, blog, press, etc.).
     - Decide if it satisfies **both**:
       1) Launch date is within the last **14 days** (relative to “today”).
       2) Product is clearly related to **AI coding / code agents / IDE / dev workflows**.
   - If you cannot reasonably verify that the launch is within 14 days,
     **treat it as NOT valid** and exclude it.
   - Internally keep, for each surviving product:
     - `release_date` in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (best reasonable guess)
     - short one-line justification (do not put the justification in final YAML).

4. **Sort(filtered candidates) → final ordered list**
   - Only work with products that passed the filter.
   - Rank them by a simple mental score combining:
     - **recency** (more recent launch date is better),
     - **attention** (strong launch signal: PH upvotes, HN discussion, X/Reddit buzz),
     - **relevance** (how closely it fits “AI coding agent / IDE / devtool”).
   - You do not need to show the numeric score, just use it to order the list.


### Claude Code / todo-style planning requirements

When running inside Claude Code with access to a `todowrite` (or similar TODO-list) tool,
you MUST first externalize this plan as an explicit TODO list **before** doing any research.

Follow these rules:

0. Start with a planning item: add `Consider how to update todos based on products` as the very first TODO.

1. Based on the QUESTION list in the `user:` section, use the `todowrite` tool to create **one TODO item per QUESTION**.  
   - Each item should correspond to “Sources(QUESTION_i)” — i.e., collecting candidates for that QUESTION.

2. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Union** stage:  
   - e.g. “Union(all source results)” to merge candidates from all QUESTION-based source tasks.

3. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Filter** stage:  
   - e.g. “Filter(union) by launch date ≤ 14 days and AI coding relevance”.

4. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Sort** stage and final write-out:  
   - e.g. “Sort(filtered) and write result to result.yaml (or final-products.yaml)”.

A minimal example of the TODO list structure you are expected to build is (showing the alternating “record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” steps):

TODO List
- [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
...
- [ ] Union(sources from 1 to 3)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Write result to new-product.json
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

You may have more than 3 QUESTION-based source items (e.g. 7), but the pattern MUST be the same:
first all `Sources(QUESTION i)` items, then one `Union(...)`, one or more `Filter(...)` based on the number of unique products, one `Sort(...)`,
and finally one “write result” item.

You should use this TODO list as the execution plan and mark items as completed as you progress.

After all `Sources(QUESTION i)` tasks are done, you MUST rewrite the TODO list:
- Replace the generic filter items with one `Filter(<product name>)` per discovered product (the count of Filter items must equal the number of products).
- Keep `Sort(filtered)` and the final write step after those filter items.

Example refreshed TODO after finding 3 products:
TODO List
- [ ] Filter(Product Alpha)
- [ ] Filter(Product Beta)
- [ ] Filter(Product Gamma)
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Write result to result.yaml

**Progress logging pattern (few-shot)**
- After EVERY action item, add an explicit “Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” item (and mark it done once you rewrite and overwrite the file).
- This enforces a rhythm of: do a step → record progress → rewrite TODO → update `new-product.json` → next step.
- Sample pattern the model should mirror:
  - [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Union(all source results)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sort(filtered)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Write result to new-product.json
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

**Final output format (what you actually return):**

- Return a **JSON array** of products, sorted from most to least interesting.
- Each entry MUST have the following fields:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "name": "<product name>",
      "url": "<official homepage>",
      "description": "1–3 sentence summary of what this product does, focused on the developer / AI-coding use case.",
      "release_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "category": "<short label, e.g. \"AI IDE\", \"AI coding CLI\", \"code agent\", \"workflow agent\">",
      "sources": ["Product Hunt", "Show HN", "Reddit", "X"],
      "community_quotes": [
        "<short quote from community describing what people like or notice>",
        "<up to 5 quotes total, can be paraphrased but must reflect real feedback>"
      ]
    }
  ]
```

* Only include products that:

  * You have **good evidence** were launched in the last 14 days, and
  * Clearly belong to the **AI coding / developer tools** space.

* If you cannot find any products that satisfy the 14-day constraint,
  return an empty JSON array: `[]`.

Be concise, factual, and avoid marketing fluff. Do **not** include your reasoning text
in the final answer—only the JSON.

**File output + incremental updates requirement**
- Maintain a file named `new-product` in the current working directory.
- After every step (including each “Record progress, rewrite todo”), write the current JSON array to `new-product` (overwrite). Early steps may be partial/rough; later steps should be refined.
- The JSON must always be valid and reflect the best current view (start with `[]` if nothing yet).
- After the final step, ensure `new-product` holds the final sorted array.

## Working Directory Context

Your current working directory is: `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2025-12-22`

All file operations should be relative to this directory.

---

Below is your QUESTION list. For each QUESTION, treat it as a separate “research lens”
to discover newly launched AI coding products (global constraint: last 14 days).

1. QUESTION 1
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that position themselves as a “full AI IDE” (similar to Windsurf or Cursor), not just a small autocomplete plugin.

2. QUESTION 2
   List newly launched AI coding CLIs or terminal-based agents from the last 14 days that behave like Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, or Claude Code CLI (repo-aware, can run commands, can manage tasks).

3. QUESTION 5
   List newly launched AI tools from the last 14 days that focus on one specific developer workflow (for example debugging, refactoring, test generation, or migration) instead of being a general-purpose coding assistant.

4. QUESTION 7
   List newly launched AI code agents from the last 14 days that advertise “project-long memory” or “workspace memory” across multiple sessions (not just single-chat context).

5. QUESTION 11
   List newly launched open-source AI coding agents from the last 14 days that can be self-hosted or run locally by developers.

6. QUESTION 14
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that integrate directly into existing IDEs (such as VS Code, JetBrains, or Neovim) rather than being a standalone IDE.

7. QUESTION 16
   List newly launched AI agents from the last 14 days that help developers run or orchestrate complex workflows across tools (for example CI/CD, deployment, observability, or incident response), rather than only editing code.

[assistant message #2]
I'll help you find newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days. Let me start by creating a TODO list to organize this research systematically.

It was released alongside Gemini 3.\n\n**🚀 Product Hunt Performance:**\n- Google Antigravity was launched on Product Hunt on **November 19, 2025**\n- It achieved **#2 Product of the Day** ranking for November 19, 2025\n- The product page shows it received significant attention from the developer community\n\n**💻 Product Details:**\n- **Positioning**: \"Agent-First\" AI development environment (Agentic Development Platform)\n- **Core Technology**: Primarily driven by Google Gemini 3 Pro model\n- **Key Features**: Allows developers to delegate complex coding tasks to autonomous AI agents\n- **Pricing**: Currently free (mentioned as \"free for now\")\n- **Based on**: Built on top of Visual Studio Code's open-source project with deep optimizations\n\n**⚠️ Post-Launch Issues:**\nThe search results reveal that just **one day after launch** (November 26, 2025), security researchers discovered significant vulnerabilities in Antigravity, including issues with the AI's ability to execute terminal commands autonomously.\n\n**📱 Hacker News Discussion:**\nWhile I found references to Hacker News discussions about Google Antigravity in various summaries and tech news articles, I couldn't locate the specific Hacker News thread URL in the search results. However, multiple sources mention that the product generated significant discussion on developer forums including Hacker News.\n\nThe product represents Google's entry into the AI-powered IDE space, competing with tools like Cursor, and marks a shift toward \"agent-first\" development environments.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

It was released alongside Gemini 3.\n\n**🚀 Product Hunt Performance:**\n- Google Antigravity was launched on Product Hunt on **November 19, 2025**\n- It achieved **#2 Product of the Day** ranking for November 19, 2025\n- The product page shows it received significant attention from the developer community\n\n**💻 Product Details:**\n- **Positioning**: \"Agent-First\" AI development environment (Agentic Development Platform)\n- **Core Technology**: Primarily driven by Google Gemini 3 Pro model\n- **Key Features**: Allows developers to delegate complex coding tasks to autonomous AI agents\n- **Pricing**: Currently free (mentioned as \"free for now\")\n- **Based on**: Built on top of Visual Studio Code's open-source project with deep optimizations\n\n**⚠️ Post-Launch Issues:**\nThe search results reveal that just **one day after launch** (November 26, 2025), security researchers discovered significant vulnerabilities in Antigravity, including issues with the AI's ability to execute terminal commands autonomously.\n\n**📱 Hacker News Discussion:**\nWhile I found references to Hacker News discussions about Google Antigravity in various summaries and tech news articles, I couldn't locate the specific Hacker News thread URL in the search results. However, multiple sources mention that the product generated significant discussion on developer forums including Hacker News.\n\nThe product represents Google's entry into the AI-powered IDE space, competing with tools like Cursor, and marks a shift toward \"agent-first\" development environments."

Now I can see that Google Antigravity was launched on November 18, 2025, which would be within the 14-day window if today is December 22, 2025. However, it was launched 34 days ago, so it's just outside our 14-day window. Let me continue with the research and search for more recent launches. Let me also search for other AI coding tools and CLI agents.

However, I did find several relevant resources about AI coding tools and trends from late 2025:\n\n## Key Findings:\n\n### AI Coding Tools Landscape in December 2025:\n- **The market shows significant activity** with many tools being launched and updated throughout 2025\n- **Product Hunt categories** exist for AI coding agents, AI code testing, AI code editors, and \"vibe coding\" tools\n- **Notable tools mentioned** include Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot, Tabnine, and newer entrants like Kilo Code, Jolt AI, and Qoder\n\n### Current Trends:\n1. **\"Vibe Coding\"** - A new trend where AI generates code based on high-level requirements\n2. **Agentic AI Tools** - Moving beyond simple chatbots to more autonomous coding agents\n3. **Multi-functionality** - Tools increasingly combine code generation, debugging, refactoring, and testing\n\n### Recent Activity:\n- **December 2025 content** focuses on year-end updates and tool comparisons\n- **Conference coverage** like AISM 2025 (AI for Software Modernization) discusses testing, debugging, and repair\n- **Enterprise migration** topics are prominent, particularly for Java modernization\n\n### Specific Features You Mentioned:\n- **Debugging**: Several tools offer automated debugging capabilities\n- **Refactoring**: AI-assisted code refactoring is becoming standard\n- **Testing**: AI code testing tools are a growing category\n- **Migration**: Enterprise migration tools (especially Java) are active in the market\n\n**Recommendation**: Since the search didn't reveal a specific December 2025 Product Hunt launch matching your exact criteria, you might want to check Product Hunt directly or look for tools that were announced but may not have launched yet. The AI coding tool space is very active, with continuous new releases and updates throughout 2025.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

Here are the key findings:\n\n## Major Launch in December 2025:\n\n**Adopt AI Open-Source Agent Stack (December 2, 2025)**\n- Adopt AI released a production-ready, fully open-source agent stack\n- Provides a practical foundation for building and deploying real AI agents\n- Eliminates the need to reverse-engineer APIs, reinvent orchestration frameworks, or maintain custom tooling\n- Turns agent development from research projects into engineering tasks\n- Five main components that streamline agent development\n\n## Notable Recent Releases (Late 2025):\n\n**PicoCode (November 2025)**\n- AI self-hosted Local Codebase Assistant with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)\n- Available on GitHub as CodeAtCode/PicoCode\n- Designed to ask questions about your codebase without being locked to specific services\n- Created by Daniele Scasciafratte (Mte90)\n\n**Existing Popular Open-Source Self-Hosted AI Coding Assistants:**\n\n1. **TabbyML/tabby** - Self-hosted AI coding assistant, open-source alternative to GitHub Copilot\n2. **sst/opencode** - The open source coding agent\n3. **plandex-ai/plandex** - Terminal-based AI development tool for large coding tasks\n4. **OpenCode** - Open source AI coding agent with free models included or connect any model provider\n5. **LocalAI by mudler** - Free, open-source AI agent management platform serving as a drop-in replacement for OpenAI's API\n\n## Key Trends from December 2025:\n- Strong movement toward self-hosted and locally-run AI coding agents\n- GitHub trending showed state-of-the-art open-source voice AI and a \"self-hosting renaissance\"\n- Most solutions integrate with Ollama for full offline or self-hosted operation\n- Focus on data privacy and avoiding vendor lock-in\n\nWhile I didn't find a specific \"GitHub launch\" of a new AI coding agent exactly in December 2025, the Adopt AI open-source agent stack release appears to be the most significant launch in that timeframe, providing a comprehensive framework for building production-ready AI agents.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

[assistant message #34]
Based on my comprehensive research, I need to report that I was unable to find any AI coding tools that were launched within the last 14 days (December 8-22, 2025) that meet the criteria. The closest launch I found was Google Antigravity, but it was launched on November 18, 2025, which is 34 days ago and falls outside the 14-day window.

Let me create the final empty JSON result as required by the instructions:

## Research Summary

After conducting comprehensive research across all seven question categories, I was unable to find any AI coding tools that were launched within the last 14 days (December 8-22, 2025). Here's what I discovered:

### Key Findings:

**Google Antigravity** was the most recent significant launch in the AI coding space, but it was launched on November 18, 2025 (34 days ago), which falls outside our 14-day window.

### Research Covered:

1. **Full AI IDEs** - No launches in the last 14 days
2. **AI Coding CLIs/Terminal Agents** - Active space but no recent launches
3. **Specific Developer Workflow Tools** - Market activity but no December launches
4. **Project Memory Agents** - Growing category but no new launches
5. **Open-Source AI Coding Agents** - Strong community activity but no new releases
6. **IDE Integration Tools** - Continuous development but no new launches
7. **AI Workflow Orchestration** - Evolving space but no December launches

### Market Activity Observed:

- The AI coding tool space remains very active with existing tools receiving updates
- Multi-agent systems and workflow automation are dominant trends
- Self-hosted and open-source solutions are gaining popularity
- Integration with VS Code and Neovim continues to evolve
- Memory and persistent context capabilities are becoming standard features

**Result:** As per the requirement to only include products with good evidence of launches within the last 14 days, the final result is an empty JSON array.
