[system]
You are an AI research analyst specialized in AI developer tools:
code agents, AI IDEs, AI coding CLIs, and related devtools.

Your **global goal**:
- Find genuinely new products that have been publicly launched in the **last 14 days**
- AND that clearly target **programming / code / AI dev workflows**
- THEN summarize only the valid ones in a **clean YAML list**.

You MUST treat the questions in the `user:` section as your **research QUESTION list**.
Each QUESTION is a different “angle” on the same market (e.g., full AI IDE, CLI, workflow-focused, etc.).

To organize your reasoning, use this formula:

> Answer = Sort( Filter( Union(Sources) ) )

You must conceptually follow these four stages:

1. **Sources → candidate list (per QUESTION)**
   - For each QUESTION from the `user:` section:
     - Search the web and relevant directories / launch pages.
     - Collect as many **candidate products** as are reasonably relevant.
   - For each candidate, internally track at least:
     - `name` (product name)
     - `url` (official homepage or primary landing page)
     - `description` (1–3 sentences in English summarizing what it does)
     - `sources` (which QUESTION(s) and which site(s) you saw it on)
   - At this stage you are allowed to over-collect; do **not** filter by date yet unless it is trivial.

2. **Union(candidates) → unified candidate set**
   - Merge candidates across all QUESTIONS into a single conceptual set:
     - Deduplicate products that clearly refer to the same thing
       (same URL, or obviously the same product name + branding).
   - After this step you have a unified **candidate pool**:
     - It may still contain old products, or products outside our domain.

3. **Filter(Union) → filtered candidate list**
   - For each product in the unified pool:
     - Investigate its **launch / first public release date** from credible public info
       (official site, launch post, Product Hunt / HN launch, blog, press, etc.).
     - Decide if it satisfies **both**:
       1) Launch date is within the last **14 days** (relative to “today”).
       2) Product is clearly related to **AI coding / code agents / IDE / dev workflows**.
   - If you cannot reasonably verify that the launch is within 14 days,
     **treat it as NOT valid** and exclude it.
   - Internally keep, for each surviving product:
     - `release_date` in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (best reasonable guess)
     - short one-line justification (do not put the justification in final YAML).

4. **Sort(filtered candidates) → final ordered list**
   - Only work with products that passed the filter.
   - Rank them by a simple mental score combining:
     - **recency** (more recent launch date is better),
     - **attention** (strong launch signal: PH upvotes, HN discussion, X/Reddit buzz),
     - **relevance** (how closely it fits “AI coding agent / IDE / devtool”).
   - You do not need to show the numeric score, just use it to order the list.


### Claude Code / todo-style planning requirements

When running inside Claude Code with access to a `todowrite` (or similar TODO-list) tool,
you MUST first externalize this plan as an explicit TODO list **before** doing any research.

Follow these rules:

0. Start with a planning item: add `Consider how to update todos based on products` as the very first TODO.

1. Based on the QUESTION list in the `user:` section, use the `todowrite` tool to create **one TODO item per QUESTION**.  
   - Each item should correspond to “Sources(QUESTION_i)” — i.e., collecting candidates for that QUESTION.

2. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Union** stage:  
   - e.g. “Union(all source results)” to merge candidates from all QUESTION-based source tasks.

3. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Filter** stage:  
   - e.g. “Filter(union) by launch date ≤ 14 days and AI coding relevance”.

4. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Sort** stage and final write-out:  
   - e.g. “Sort(filtered) and write result to result.yaml (or final-products.yaml)”.

A minimal example of the TODO list structure you are expected to build is (showing the alternating “record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” steps):

TODO List
- [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
...
- [ ] Union(sources from 1 to 3)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Write result to new-product.json
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

You may have more than 3 QUESTION-based source items (e.g. 7), but the pattern MUST be the same:
first all `Sources(QUESTION i)` items, then one `Union(...)`, one or more `Filter(...)` based on the number of unique products, one `Sort(...)`,
and finally one “write result” item.

You should use this TODO list as the execution plan and mark items as completed as you progress.

After all `Sources(QUESTION i)` tasks are done, you MUST rewrite the TODO list:
- Replace the generic filter items with one `Filter(<product name>)` per discovered product (the count of Filter items must equal the number of products).
- Keep `Sort(filtered)` and the final write step after those filter items.

Example refreshed TODO after finding 3 products:
TODO List
- [ ] Filter(Product Alpha)
- [ ] Filter(Product Beta)
- [ ] Filter(Product Gamma)
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Write result to result.yaml

**Progress logging pattern (few-shot)**
- After EVERY action item, add an explicit “Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” item (and mark it done once you rewrite and overwrite the file).
- This enforces a rhythm of: do a step → record progress → rewrite TODO → update `new-product.json` → next step.
- Sample pattern the model should mirror:
  - [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Union(all source results)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sort(filtered)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Write result to new-product.json
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

**Final output format (what you actually return):**

- Return a **JSON array** of products, sorted from most to least interesting.
- Each entry MUST have the following fields:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "name": "<product name>",
      "url": "<official homepage>",
      "description": "1–3 sentence summary of what this product does, focused on the developer / AI-coding use case.",
      "release_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "category": "<short label, e.g. \"AI IDE\", \"AI coding CLI\", \"code agent\", \"workflow agent\">",
      "sources": ["Product Hunt", "Show HN", "Reddit", "X"],
      "community_quotes": [
        "<short quote from community describing what people like or notice>",
        "<up to 5 quotes total, can be paraphrased but must reflect real feedback>"
      ]
    }
  ]
```

* Only include products that:

  * You have **good evidence** were launched in the last 14 days, and
  * Clearly belong to the **AI coding / developer tools** space.

* If you cannot find any products that satisfy the 14-day constraint,
  return an empty JSON array: `[]`.

Be concise, factual, and avoid marketing fluff. Do **not** include your reasoning text
in the final answer—only the JSON.

**File output + incremental updates requirement**
- Maintain a file named `new-product` in the current working directory.
- After every step (including each “Record progress, rewrite todo”), write the current JSON array to `new-product` (overwrite). Early steps may be partial/rough; later steps should be refined.
- The JSON must always be valid and reflect the best current view (start with `[]` if nothing yet).
- After the final step, ensure `new-product` holds the final sorted array.

## Working Directory Context

Your current working directory is: `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2025-12-16`

All file operations should be relative to this directory.

---

Below is your QUESTION list. For each QUESTION, treat it as a separate “research lens”
to discover newly launched AI coding products (global constraint: last 14 days).

1. QUESTION 1
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that position themselves as a “full AI IDE” (similar to Windsurf or Cursor), not just a small autocomplete plugin.

2. QUESTION 2
   List newly launched AI coding CLIs or terminal-based agents from the last 14 days that behave like Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, or Claude Code CLI (repo-aware, can run commands, can manage tasks).

3. QUESTION 5
   List newly launched AI tools from the last 14 days that focus on one specific developer workflow (for example debugging, refactoring, test generation, or migration) instead of being a general-purpose coding assistant.

4. QUESTION 7
   List newly launched AI code agents from the last 14 days that advertise “project-long memory” or “workspace memory” across multiple sessions (not just single-chat context).

5. QUESTION 11
   List newly launched open-source AI coding agents from the last 14 days that can be self-hosted or run locally by developers.

6. QUESTION 14
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that integrate directly into existing IDEs (such as VS Code, JetBrains, or Neovim) rather than being a standalone IDE.

7. QUESTION 16
   List newly launched AI agents from the last 14 days that help developers run or orchestrate complex workflows across tools (for example CI/CD, deployment, observability, or incident response), rather than only editing code.

[assistant message #2]
I'll help you research newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days. Let me start by creating a TODO list to organize this research systematically.

This could be because:\n- December 2025 launches haven't occurred yet (current date is June 17, 2025)\n- The search may need to be more specific for upcoming December launches\n\nWould you like me to search for any specific AI IDE tools or look for announcements about upcoming December 2025 launches?\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

Here are the key findings:\n\n## Recent AI IDE and Coding Tool Launches on Product Hunt (2025)\n\n### **Trae - The Responsive Coding Agent**\n- **Launch Date**: November 12, 2025 (Solo version) and January 23, 2025 (original)\n- **Description**: Trae is positioned as a next-gen coding environment powered by AI with native IDE feel and flexible working modes\n- **Notable Achievement**: Achieved \"Product of the Day\" status on Product Hunt\n\n### **Qoder**\n- Recently launched AI code editor\n- Mentioned alongside established tools like Cursor, Claude Code, and Windsurf\n- Handles multi-file changes and deep context\n\n### **Nao**\n- **Launch Date**: Featured November 26, 2025\n- **Description**: AI-powered data IDE specifically designed for analysts, engineers, and scientists\n- **Features**: Supports SQL, Python, or dbt workflows with preview capabilities and issue detection\n\n### **opencode**\n- **Launch Date**: July 11, 2025\n- **Description**: Open-source AI coding agent built for terminal use\n- **Integration**: Works with Claude, OpenAI, Google, or local models\n\n### **General AI Coding Tool Trends on Product Hunt**\nThe search reveals that AI coding tools on Product Hunt generally fall into two main categories:\n1. **IDE-based tools** (like Cursor and GitHub Copilot)\n2. **Terminal-based setups** (like opencode)\n\n**Note**: While I found several AI coding tools that launched throughout 2025, I didn't find specific mentions of tools launching exactly in December 2025. This could be because:\n- December 2025 launches haven't occurred yet (current date is June 17, 2025)\n- The search may need to be more specific for upcoming December launches\n\nWould you like me to search for any specific AI IDE tools or look for announcements about upcoming December 2025 launches?"

The search results show various AI coding assistants and CLI tools from 2025, but none specifically matching your query for a December 2025 Product Hunt launch.\n\nHere's what I did find regarding AI CLI tools and coding assistants in 2025:\n\n## Recent AI CLI Tools in 2025:\n\n**Google Gemini CLI** - Launched in June 2025\n- Google's open-source AI agent for terminals\n- Provides code understanding, file manipulation, and command execution\n- Available as a free, open-source terminal tool\n\n**Other Notable AI CLI Tools:**\n- **Cosine CLI** - An agentic AI coding assistant that ranked #2 on Product Hunt (specific date unclear)\n- **Aider** - Open-source CLI tool that pairs with GPT models\n- **Codex CLI** - Terminal-based AI coding assistant\n- **Deep Agent CLI** - Open-source coding tool with persistent memory\n\n## Product Hunt AI Coding Landscape:\nThe search results show that Product Hunt has active categories for:\n- AI coding agents\n- AI code editors\n- Various terminal-based AI development tools\n\nHowever, the specific information about a December 2025 launch of a new AI CLI coding assistant on Product Hunt doesn't appear to be available in the current search results. This could be because:\n\n1. The launch hasn't happened yet (we're currently in August 2025)\n2. The product launch information isn't widely indexed yet\n3. The search query needs to be refined\n\nIf you're looking for information about a specific product, you might want to check back closer to December 2025 or provide more details about the specific tool you're interested in.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

The search results show various AI coding assistants and CLI tools from 2025, but none specifically matching your query for a December 2025 Product Hunt launch.\n\nHere's what I did find regarding AI CLI tools and coding assistants in 2025:\n\n## Recent AI CLI Tools in 2025:\n\n**Google Gemini CLI** - Launched in June 2025\n- Google's open-source AI agent for terminals\n- Provides code understanding, file manipulation, and command execution\n- Available as a free, open-source terminal tool\n\n**Other Notable AI CLI Tools:**\n- **Cosine CLI** - An agentic AI coding assistant that ranked #2 on Product Hunt (specific date unclear)\n- **Aider** - Open-source CLI tool that pairs with GPT models\n- **Codex CLI** - Terminal-based AI coding assistant\n- **Deep Agent CLI** - Open-source coding tool with persistent memory\n\n## Product Hunt AI Coding Landscape:\nThe search results show that Product Hunt has active categories for:\n- AI coding agents\n- AI code editors\n- Various terminal-based AI development tools\n\nHowever, the specific information about a December 2025 launch of a new AI CLI coding assistant on Product Hunt doesn't appear to be available in the current search results. This could be because:\n\n1. The launch hasn't happened yet (we're currently in August 2025)\n2. The product launch information isn't widely indexed yet\n3. The search query needs to be refined\n\nIf you're looking for information about a specific product, you might want to check back closer to December 2025 or provide more details about the specific tool you're interested in."

However, I found several relevant AI tools and categories that are popular on Product Hunt:\n\n## Relevant AI Debugging/Development Tools Found:\n\n### **TestSprite** - AI Testing Agent\n- An AI agent that tests, fixes, and validates software\n- Automates the entire testing workflow from test planning to code generation\n- Covers both frontend and backend software testing\n\n### **AI Coding Agents Category**\nProduct Hunt has a dedicated category for AI coding agents that:\n- Suggest code\n- Refactor existing code\n- Debug code issues\n- Integrate with editors, repositories, and APIs\n\n### **AI Code Testing Category**\n- Focuses on tools that automatically review, analyze, and validate code for errors or vulnerabilities\n- Several tools in this category offer test generation capabilities\n\n### **Cursor - AI Code Editor**\n- AI coding assistant that integrates directly with coding workflows\n- Specializes in debugging, refactoring, and code generation\n\n## Notable Mentions:\n- **Refraction**: A code generation tool using AI to generate unit tests, documentation, and refactor code\n- **Foretoken AI**: AI-native engineer hiring platform that includes debugging challenges\n\n## Search Limitations:\nThe search didn't return specific December 2025 Product Hunt launches for AI debugging tools, which could mean:\n1. Such tools haven't launched yet in December 2025 (as it's currently early December)\n2. The specific combination of features (debugging + test generation + refactoring) might be rare\n3. Recent launches may not be indexed yet by search engines\n\nWould you like me to search for more specific tool names or expand the search criteria to include recent AI development tools in general?\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

      "Based on my web search results, I wasn't able to find any specific AI debugging tools that launched on Product Hunt in December 2025 with the exact combination of features you mentioned (test generation and refactoring). However, I found several relevant AI tools and categories that are popular on Product Hunt:\n\n## Relevant AI Debugging/Development Tools Found:\n\n### **TestSprite** - AI Testing Agent\n- An AI agent that tests, fixes, and validates software\n- Automates the entire testing workflow from test planning to code generation\n- Covers both frontend and backend software testing\n\n### **AI Coding Agents Category**\nProduct Hunt has a dedicated category for AI coding agents that:\n- Suggest code\n- Refactor existing code\n- Debug code issues\n- Integrate with editors, repositories, and APIs\n\n### **AI Code Testing Category**\n- Focuses on tools that automatically review, analyze, and validate code for errors or vulnerabilities\n- Several tools in this category offer test generation capabilities\n\n### **Cursor - AI Code Editor**\n- AI coding assistant that integrates directly with coding workflows\n- Specializes in debugging, refactoring, and code generation\n\n## Notable Mentions:\n- **Refraction**: A code generation tool using AI to generate unit tests, documentation, and refactor code\n- **Foretoken AI**: AI-native engineer hiring platform that includes debugging challenges\n\n## Search Limitations:\nThe search didn't return specific December 2025 Product Hunt launches for AI debugging tools, which could mean:\n1. Such tools haven't launched yet in December 2025 (as it's currently early December)\n2. The specific combination of features (debugging + test generation + refactoring) might be rare\n3. Recent launches may not be indexed yet by search engines\n\nWould you like me to search for more specific tool names or expand the search criteria to include recent AI development tools in general?"

This could indicate:\n- The search query might be too specific or the product hasn't been launched yet\n- The product might use different terminology\n- It could be a future or planned release not yet indexed\n\nWould you like me to search with modified terms or explore any specific aspect of long memory AI coding agents further?\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

      "Based on my web search for \"Product Hunt\" \"long memory\" AI coding agent December 2025 \"persistent context\", here are the relevant findings:\n\n## Search Results Summary\n\nThe search returned several interesting results, though not specifically about Product Hunt launches. Here are the key findings:\n\n### Most Relevant Results:\n\n1. **AI News December 13, 2025** (BinaryverseAI)\n   - Mentions \"Claude Agent SDK: Context Engineering & Long Memory\"\n   - Discusses \"a private, project-aware coding agent\"\n   - Published 3 days ago from the search date\n\n2. **Daily Thoughts | Euler's Identity LLC**\n   - Features an article titled \"The Long Memory of Progress: AI Systems Thinking Beyond Human Timescales\"\n   - Dated December 08, 2025\n   - Discusses \"coding agents signals a positive direction\"\n\n3. **Long-Context Windows in Large Language Models** (Medium)\n   - Discusses how \"long memory prevents the AI from repeating questions or forgetting user preferences\"\n   - Mentions applications in \"Personalized assistants\"\n   - Published 7 months ago\n\n4. **Claude Component Integration** (Facebook/Origami Community)\n   - References \"Deep Thinking and Long Memory Claude 4\"\n   - Claims it can \"keep track of up to 200,000 tokens\"\n   - Published 1 year ago\n\n### Notable Absence:\nThe search didn't return specific results about Product Hunt launches in December 2025 featuring AI coding agents with long memory capabilities. This could indicate:\n- The search query might be too specific or the product hasn't been launched yet\n- The product might use different terminology\n- It could be a future or planned release not yet indexed\n\nWould you like me to search with modified terms or explore any specific aspect of long memory AI coding agents further?"

The tool you're looking for hasn't been announced yet\n2. It might be a project still in development without public announcements\n3. The information might be available through private channels or company insiders\n\nIf you have additional details about the specific company, tool name, or features you're looking for, I could conduct a more targeted search.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

The tool you're looking for hasn't been announced yet\n2. It might be a project still in development without public announcements\n3. The information might be available through private channels or company insiders\n\nIf you have additional details about the specific company, tool name, or features you're looking for, I could conduct a more targeted search."

[assistant message #87]
Now I'll complete the Union stage by merging all candidate products from the sources. Based on my research, I didn't find any products that were clearly launched within the last 14 days (December 2-16, 2025). All the tools I found were either:

1. Launched earlier in 2025 (or before)
2. Existing tools that have been around
3. Future announcements without specific launch dates in the 14-day window

Let me proceed with the union and filtering stages.
