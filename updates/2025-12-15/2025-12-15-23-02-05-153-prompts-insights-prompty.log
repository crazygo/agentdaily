You are an AI research analyst focused on AI coding thought leadership. Track recent insights with disciplined TODO planning and continuous file updates.
Global goal:
- Find technical insights/opinions/discussions in the **last 7 days** from the provided thought leaders and sources.
- Return a clean JSON array of insights, sorted by recency/relevance.
- Keep `insights.json` valid and updated after every step (start with `[]` if empty).
### TODO planning rules
- Start with `Consider how to update todos based on insights`.
- Create one `Sources(<leader/source>)` item per thought leader (and any extra sources you add).
- After each action, add and complete: `Record progress, rewrite todo, update insights.json`.
- After all Sources are done, rewrite the TODO list so Filters are per insight found (one `Filter(<insight title or source>)` per insight), then include `Sort(filtered)` and `Write result to insights.json`.

- [ ] Consider how to update todos based on insights
- [ ] Sources(Andrej Karpathy)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update insights.json
- [ ] Sources(Simon Willison)

## Working Directory Context

Your current working directory is: `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2025-12-15`

All file operations should be relative to this directory.

---

**Today's Date**: {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE}
**Date Range**: {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE} minus 7 days = {INSERT_START_DATE}
**IMPORTANT TIME CONSTRAINTS**:
- Only include content published/posted between {INSERT_START_DATE} and {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE}
- When searching, ALWAYS use date filters: "after:{INSERT_START_DATE} before:{INSERT_CURRENT_DATE}" or equivalent date range syntax
- For Twitter/X: Use advanced search with date range filters
- For Google/Blog searches: Use "after:{INSERT_START_DATE}" or site-specific date filters
- For Hacker News/Reddit: Filter by time period (past week) or use date-based search
- For YouTube: Use upload date filter (last 7 days)
- **CRITICAL**: If a source does not have a clear publication date within the 7-day window, EXCLUDE it from results
- Verify publication dates before including in insights.json

Output format (JSON array):
```json
[
  {
    "title": "Headline or discussion topic",
    "description": "Summary of key points and takeaways",
    "author": "Who wrote or said it",
    "source": "Blog | Twitter | YouTube | Podcast | TechMedia | HN | Reddit | Paper | Platform",
    "url": "https://link-to-content",
    "published_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "topics": ["Relevant", "Tags", "Here"],
    "type": "technical | opinion | tutorial | discussion"
  }
]
```
- **Date validation**: Each insight MUST include a `published_date` field, and it MUST be within the 7-day window ({INSERT_START_DATE} to {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE})
- If no valid insights in the 7-day window, return `[]`.
File output + incremental updates:
- Maintain `insights.json` in the current working directory.
- After every step (including each "Record progress, rewrite todo"), overwrite `insights.json` with the best current JSON (start with `[]` if nothing yet).
- **Before writing to insights.json**: Verify that each insight's `published_date` is within the 7-day window. Remove any insights outside this range.
- Final state must hold the sorted array of insights (sorted by date, most recent first).

However, for the most specific and recent content from the exact date range you mentioned (December 8-15, 2025), you might want to check his official social media accounts or blog directly.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

## Summary

I've successfully completed a comprehensive analysis of AI coding thought leadership insights from the last 7 days (December 8-15, 2025). Here's what was accomplished:

### Key Findings:

**From 4 valid insights found within the date range:**

1. **MIT Technology Review** (Dec 15) - Reports 65% of developers using AI coding tools weekly, despite widespread skepticism
2. **MIT Technology Review** (Dec 15) - Documents the "great AI hype correction of 2025" with signs of market saturation  
3. **The Verge** (Dec 15) - Podcast discussing the paradox of developers using AI tools despite trust issues
4. **Simon Willison** (Dec 10) - Comprehensive guide on building HTML tools with LLMs, covering 150+ tools built over 2 years

### Key Themes Identified:

- **High Adoption, Low Trust**: AI coding tools have massive adoption (65% weekly usage) but developers remain skeptical
- **Hype Correction**: The market is showing signs of saturation and moving beyond initial hype cycles
- **Practical Patterns**: Developers are establishing concrete patterns for LLM-assisted development
- **Tool Evolution**: Shift from traditional IDEs to more integrated approaches like terminal-based tools

### Sources Analyzed:
✅ Individual thought leaders (Karpathy, Willison, Masad, Fridman)
✅ YouTube channels (Fireship, Two Minute Papers, AI Explained)  
✅ Tech media (TechCrunch, The Verge, MIT Technology Review, Ars Technica)
✅ Technical platforms (ArXiv, Papers with Code, Towards Data Science)
✅ Community platforms (Hacker News, Reddit programming communities)
✅ Podcast sources (The Changelog, Software Engineering Daily, etc.)

The updated `insights.json` file now contains only the most relevant, recent insights sorted by publication date with all required metadata fields properly formatted.
