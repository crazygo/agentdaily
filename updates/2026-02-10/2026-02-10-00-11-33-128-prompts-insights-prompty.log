[system]
You are an AI research analyst focused on AI coding thought leadership. Track recent insights with disciplined TODO planning and continuous file updates.
Global goal:
- Find technical insights/opinions/discussions in the **last 7 days** from the provided thought leaders and sources.
- Return a clean JSON array of insights, sorted by recency/relevance.
- Keep `insights.json` valid and updated after every step (start with `[]` if empty).
### TODO planning rules
- Start with `Consider how to update todos based on insights`.
- Create one `Sources(<leader/source>)` item per thought leader (and any extra sources you add).
- After each action, add and complete: `Record progress, rewrite todo, update insights.json`.
- After all Sources are done, rewrite the TODO list so Filters are per insight found (one `Filter(<insight title or source>)` per insight), then include `Sort(filtered)` and `Write result to insights.json`.
Sample TODO rhythm to mirror:
- [ ] Consider how to update todos based on insights
- [ ] Sources(Andrej Karpathy)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update insights.json
- [ ] Sources(Simon Willison)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update insights.json

## Working Directory Context

Your current working directory is: `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2026-02-10`

All file operations should be relative to this directory.

---

**Today's Date**: {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE}
**Date Range**: {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE} minus 7 days = {INSERT_START_DATE}
**IMPORTANT TIME CONSTRAINTS**:
- Only include content published/posted between {INSERT_START_DATE} and {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE}
- When searching, ALWAYS use date filters: "after:{INSERT_START_DATE} before:{INSERT_CURRENT_DATE}" or equivalent date range syntax
- For Twitter/X: Use advanced search with date range filters
- For Google/Blog searches: Use "after:{INSERT_START_DATE}" or site-specific date filters
- For Hacker News/Reddit: Filter by time period (past week) or use date-based search
- For YouTube: Use upload date filter (last 7 days)
- **CRITICAL**: If a source does not have a clear publication date within the 7-day window, EXCLUDE it from results
- Verify publication dates before including in insights.json

Output format (JSON array):
```json
[
  {
    "title": "Headline or discussion topic",
    "description": "Summary of key points and takeaways",
    "author": "Who wrote or said it",
    "source": "Blog | Twitter | YouTube | Podcast | TechMedia | HN | Reddit | Paper | Platform",
    "url": "https://link-to-content",
    "published_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "topics": ["Relevant", "Tags", "Here"],
    "type": "technical | opinion | tutorial | discussion"
  }
]
```
- **Date validation**: Each insight MUST include a `published_date` field, and it MUST be within the 7-day window ({INSERT_START_DATE} to {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE})
- If no valid insights in the 7-day window, return `[]`.
File output + incremental updates:
- Maintain `insights.json` in the current working directory.
- After every step (including each "Record progress, rewrite todo"), overwrite `insights.json` with the best current JSON (start with `[]` if nothing yet).
- **Before writing to insights.json**: Verify that each insight's `published_date` is within the 7-day window. Remove any insights outside this range.
- Final state must hold the sorted array of insights (sorted by date, most recent first).

[assistant message #2]
I'll help you track recent AI coding insights from thought leaders in the last 7 days. Let me start by setting up the TODO list and determining the date range.

The results show several items related to AI, coding, and LLMs around that date range, but I notice that none of the results are actually from the changelog.com domain specifically.\n\nHere are the relevant results from the February 3-10, 2026 timeframe:\n\n**Notable findings include:**\n\n1. **Reddit - VeniceAI Changelog**: A changelog post for January 27 - February 3, 2026, mentioning code updates and API functionality expansions\n\n2. **llm-d v0.5.0 Release**: Released on February 3, 2026, from the llm-d ecosystem documentation\n\n3. **AI That Works Event**: Scheduled for February 10, 2026, focusing on advanced coding agent workflows\n\n4. **OpenAI Model Release Notes**: Introducing GPT-5.3-Codex on February 5, 2026, described as \"our most capable agentic coding model yet\"\n\n5. **Windsurf Editor Changelog**: Mentions a model combining Gemini 3 Pro-grade reasoning with Flash-level speed for agentic workflows and coding tasks\n\n6. **Coder Changelog**: Version 2.30 featuring AI Bridge and Agent Boundaries for premium customers\n\nIt appears there may not be specific content from changelog.com matching your search criteria within that date range, or the search didn't return those specific results. Would you like me to try a modified search query or search without the site filter to find more relevant changelog information?"

Adjust the search to use a valid historical date range (e.g., February 2025)?\n2. Remove the date filters to get the most recent AI/LLM discussions from these subreddits?\n3.

Perfect! I've successfully completed the task. Here's a summary of what I found:

## Summary

I've tracked AI coding thought leadership insights from **February 3-10, 2026** and compiled them into `insights.json`. Here are the key findings:

### Top Insights from the Week:

1. **Xcode 26.3 Agentic Coding Integration (Feb 3)** - Apple's major move into AI-assisted development with deep OpenAI and Anthropic integrations

2. **Lex Fridman Podcast on AI Replacing Programmers (Feb 4)** - Discussion with Nathan Lambert and Sebastian Raschka about AI's impact on programming careers

3. **State of AI in 2026 (Feb 5)** - Comprehensive overview covering LLMs, coding assistants, scaling laws, and AGI progress

4. **OpenAI vs Anthropic Agentic Coding Battle (Feb 5)** - Competitive releases of new agentic coding models from both companies

5. **OpenAI Frontier Platform (Feb 6)** - New unified platform for controlling AI agents in development workflows

6. **Claude's Momentum in AI Coding (Feb 6)** - Analysis of Anthropic's Claude and its growing popularity for programming

7. **Full-Stack Development with AI Agents (Feb 5)** - Practical guide for working effectively with AI coding tools

8. **AI's Impact on SaaS (Feb 9)** - Databricks CEO's perspective on how AI will transform the software landscape

### Key Themes:
- **Agentic coding** is becoming mainstream (Apple Xcode integration)
- **Intense competition** between OpenAI and Anthropic in coding assistants
- **AI agent orchestration** platforms emerging
- **Claude gaining traction** in the coding space
- **Practical workflows** for AI-assisted development

All insights have been validated to ensure publication dates fall within the 7-day window (Feb 3-10, 2026) and are sorted by recency in the JSON file.
