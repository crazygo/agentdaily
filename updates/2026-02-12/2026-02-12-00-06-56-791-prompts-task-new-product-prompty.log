[system]
You are an AI research analyst specialized in AI developer tools:
code agents, AI IDEs, AI coding CLIs, and related devtools.

Your **global goal**:
- Find genuinely new products that have been publicly launched in the **last 14 days**
- AND that clearly target **programming / code / AI dev workflows**
- THEN summarize only the valid ones in a **clean YAML list**.

You MUST treat the questions in the `user:` section as your **research QUESTION list**.
Each QUESTION is a different “angle” on the same market (e.g., full AI IDE, CLI, workflow-focused, etc.).

To organize your reasoning, use this formula:

> Answer = Sort( Filter( Union(Sources) ) )

You must conceptually follow these four stages:

1. **Sources → candidate list (per QUESTION)**
   - For each QUESTION from the `user:` section:
     - Search the web and relevant directories / launch pages.
     - Collect as many **candidate products** as are reasonably relevant.
   - For each candidate, internally track at least:
     - `name` (product name)
     - `url` (official homepage or primary landing page)
     - `description` (1–3 sentences in English summarizing what it does)
     - `sources` (which QUESTION(s) and which site(s) you saw it on)
   - At this stage you are allowed to over-collect; do **not** filter by date yet unless it is trivial.

2. **Union(candidates) → unified candidate set**
   - Merge candidates across all QUESTIONS into a single conceptual set:
     - Deduplicate products that clearly refer to the same thing
       (same URL, or obviously the same product name + branding).
   - After this step you have a unified **candidate pool**:
     - It may still contain old products, or products outside our domain.

3. **Filter(Union) → filtered candidate list**
   - For each product in the unified pool:
     - Investigate its **launch / first public release date** from credible public info
       (official site, launch post, Product Hunt / HN launch, blog, press, etc.).
     - Decide if it satisfies **both**:
       1) Launch date is within the last **14 days** (relative to “today”).
       2) Product is clearly related to **AI coding / code agents / IDE / dev workflows**.
   - If you cannot reasonably verify that the launch is within 14 days,
     **treat it as NOT valid** and exclude it.
   - Internally keep, for each surviving product:
     - `release_date` in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (best reasonable guess)
     - short one-line justification (do not put the justification in final YAML).

4. **Sort(filtered candidates) → final ordered list**
   - Only work with products that passed the filter.
   - Rank them by a simple mental score combining:
     - **recency** (more recent launch date is better),
     - **attention** (strong launch signal: PH upvotes, HN discussion, X/Reddit buzz),
     - **relevance** (how closely it fits “AI coding agent / IDE / devtool”).
   - You do not need to show the numeric score, just use it to order the list.


### Claude Code / todo-style planning requirements

When running inside Claude Code with access to a `todowrite` (or similar TODO-list) tool,
you MUST first externalize this plan as an explicit TODO list **before** doing any research.

Follow these rules:

0. Start with a planning item: add `Consider how to update todos based on products` as the very first TODO.

1. Based on the QUESTION list in the `user:` section, use the `todowrite` tool to create **one TODO item per QUESTION**.  
   - Each item should correspond to “Sources(QUESTION_i)” — i.e., collecting candidates for that QUESTION.

2. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Union** stage:  
   - e.g. “Union(all source results)” to merge candidates from all QUESTION-based source tasks.

3. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Filter** stage:  
   - e.g. “Filter(union) by launch date ≤ 14 days and AI coding relevance”.

4. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Sort** stage and final write-out:  
   - e.g. “Sort(filtered) and write result to result.yaml (or final-products.yaml)”.

A minimal example of the TODO list structure you are expected to build is (showing the alternating “record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” steps):

TODO List
- [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
...
- [ ] Union(sources from 1 to 3)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Write result to new-product.json
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

You may have more than 3 QUESTION-based source items (e.g. 7), but the pattern MUST be the same:
first all `Sources(QUESTION i)` items, then one `Union(...)`, one or more `Filter(...)` based on the number of unique products, one `Sort(...)`,
and finally one “write result” item.

You should use this TODO list as the execution plan and mark items as completed as you progress.

After all `Sources(QUESTION i)` tasks are done, you MUST rewrite the TODO list:
- Replace the generic filter items with one `Filter(<product name>)` per discovered product (the count of Filter items must equal the number of products).
- Keep `Sort(filtered)` and the final write step after those filter items.

Example refreshed TODO after finding 3 products:
TODO List
- [ ] Filter(Product Alpha)
- [ ] Filter(Product Beta)
- [ ] Filter(Product Gamma)
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Write result to result.yaml

**Progress logging pattern (few-shot)**
- After EVERY action item, add an explicit “Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” item (and mark it done once you rewrite and overwrite the file).
- This enforces a rhythm of: do a step → record progress → rewrite TODO → update `new-product.json` → next step.
- Sample pattern the model should mirror:
  - [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Union(all source results)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sort(filtered)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Write result to new-product.json
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

**Final output format (what you actually return):**

- Return a **JSON array** of products, sorted from most to least interesting.
- Each entry MUST have the following fields:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "name": "<product name>",
      "url": "<official homepage>",
      "description": "1–3 sentence summary of what this product does, focused on the developer / AI-coding use case.",
      "release_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "category": "<short label, e.g. \"AI IDE\", \"AI coding CLI\", \"code agent\", \"workflow agent\">",
      "sources": ["Product Hunt", "Show HN", "Reddit", "X"],
      "community_quotes": [
        "<short quote from community describing what people like or notice>",
        "<up to 5 quotes total, can be paraphrased but must reflect real feedback>"
      ]
    }
  ]
```

* Only include products that:

  * You have **good evidence** were launched in the last 14 days, and
  * Clearly belong to the **AI coding / developer tools** space.

* If you cannot find any products that satisfy the 14-day constraint,
  return an empty JSON array: `[]`.

Be concise, factual, and avoid marketing fluff. Do **not** include your reasoning text
in the final answer—only the JSON.

**File output + incremental updates requirement**
- Maintain a file named `new-product` in the current working directory.
- After every step (including each “Record progress, rewrite todo”), write the current JSON array to `new-product` (overwrite). Early steps may be partial/rough; later steps should be refined.
- The JSON must always be valid and reflect the best current view (start with `[]` if nothing yet).
- After the final step, ensure `new-product` holds the final sorted array.

## Working Directory Context

Your current working directory is: `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2026-02-12`

All file operations should be relative to this directory.

Below is your QUESTION list. For each QUESTION, treat it as a separate “research lens”
to discover newly launched AI coding products (global constraint: last 14 days).

1. QUESTION 1
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that position themselves as a “full AI IDE” (similar to Windsurf or Cursor), not just a small autocomplete plugin.

2. QUESTION 2
   List newly launched AI coding CLIs or terminal-based agents from the last 14 days that behave like Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, or Claude Code CLI (repo-aware, can run commands, can manage tasks).

3. QUESTION 5
   List newly launched AI tools from the last 14 days that focus on one specific developer workflow (for example debugging, refactoring, test generation, or migration) instead of being a general-purpose coding assistant.

4. QUESTION 7
   List newly launched AI code agents from the last 14 days that advertise “project-long memory” or “workspace memory” across multiple sessions (not just single-chat context).

5. QUESTION 11
   List newly launched open-source AI coding agents from the last 14 days that can be self-hosted or run locally by developers.

6. QUESTION 14
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that integrate directly into existing IDEs (such as VS Code, JetBrains, or Neovim) rather than being a standalone IDE.

7. QUESTION 16
   List newly launched AI agents from the last 14 days that help developers run or orchestrate complex workflows across tools (for example CI/CD, deployment, observability, or incident response), rather than only editing code.

Over time, it felt like Cursor caught up and then passed Windsurf.\"*\n\n### Comparison Context:\n- **Windsurf** is noted to automate more of the process, analyzing entire codebases and generating suggestions with minimal input\n- **Cursor** is described as giving developers more control\n- They're part of a broader **2026 AI coding platform landscape** that also includes Replit and Bolt.new\n\nHowever, the specific search for an AI IDE that launched in **February 2026** didn't return exact results. The search results show Windsurf and Cursor launches from 2025, with Windsurf having a Product Hunt presence in 2026. Would you like me to refine the search for more specific information about February 2026 launches?\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

Over time, it felt like Cursor caught up and then passed Windsurf.\"*\n\n### Comparison Context:\n- **Windsurf** is noted to automate more of the process, analyzing entire codebases and generating suggestions with minimal input\n- **Cursor** is described as giving developers more control\n- They're part of a broader **2026 AI coding platform landscape** that also includes Replit and Bolt.new\n\nHowever, the specific search for an AI IDE that launched in **February 2026** didn't return exact results. The search results show Windsurf and Cursor launches from 2025, with Windsurf having a Product Hunt presence in 2026. Would you like me to refine the search for more specific information about February 2026 launches?"

      "I found several relevant search results about project memory, workspace memory, and AI coding agents. Here are the key findings:\n\n## Recent Articles & Developments\n\n### 1. **\"The Memory Bank Pattern\" for AI Coding Agents** \n   - **LinkedIn article**: Discusses how to implement a persistent memory system that forces AI to document its own understanding, creating a \"persistent brain\" that survives session resets.\n   - **Key concept**: Creating a memory layer that prevents AI from losing project context.\n\n### 2. **Vietnamese Startup Byterover (Nov 2025)**\n   - **From Tech in Asia**: Byterover is building a shared memory layer for AI coding tools like Cursor and Copilot to prevent AI agents from forgetting project context.\n   - **Focus**: Boosting memory capabilities for coding assistants.\n\n### 3. **VS Code v1.109 Update (February 2026)**\n   - **From Visual Studio Magazine**: The January 2026 update transforms VS Code into a \"multi-agent orchestration hub\" with workspace priming capabilities.\n   - **Publish date**: February 5, 2026\n\n### 4. **AI Executive Assistant with File-Based Memory (Very Recent)**\n   - **From Medium (9 hours ago)**: Details building a file-based memory system that turns an AI coding assistant into a persistent executive assistant with automatic logging and context-aware features.\n\n### 5. **Mastra Changelog (February 4, 2026)**\n   - **From Mastra.ai**: Mentions \"big improvements to memory, tool loading, and a much smoother skills workflow\" across their server, UI, and CLI.\n\n### 6. **Academic Research**\n   - **ProjDevBench (arXiv)**: A benchmark for evaluating AI coding agents on end-to-end project development, testing how agents handle project requirements and repository management.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to search for more specific aspects (e.g., technical implementations, framework comparisons, or commercial tools)?"

Here's what I discovered:\n\n## Key Findings:\n\n### 1. **JetBrains AI Assistant in VS Code (May 2025)**\n- JetBrains announced their AI Assistant is now available as a VS Code extension\n- This provides integration between JetBrains' AI capabilities and VS Code\n- [Source: JetBrains Blog](https://blog.jetbrains.com/ai/2025/05/jetbrains-ai-assistant-now-in-visual-studio-code/)\n\n### 2. **VS Code February 2026 Insiders Build**\n- Visual Studio Code released their Insiders build (version 1.110) in February 2026\n- This represents the latest VS Code updates for that month\n- [Source: VS Code Updates](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_110)\n\n### 3. **Neovim AI Integration News**\n- GitHub Trending for February 2, 2026 mentioned \"Neovim Agent\" arriving\n- There are ongoing community discussions about Neovim AI support (Continue.dev GitHub issue)\n- [Source: Medium](https://medium.com/@lssmj2014/github-trending-february-2-2026-openclaw-hits-146k-neovim-agent-arrives-834ac5241951)\n\n### 4. **Market Context**\n- VS Code maintains 75.9% market share among developers\n- Neovim has 14% adoption\n- JetBrains continues competing with their AI integration solutions\n\n**Note**: I did not find any announcement about a unified AI integration extension that works across VS Code, JetBrains, AND Neovim simultaneously, nor any specific launch event for February 2026 combining all three platforms. The search results show separate AI initiatives for each platform rather than a combined solution.\n\nWould you like me to search for more specific information about any of these individual developments?"

[assistant message #84]
Now I need to filter each candidate to verify they meet the 14-day window and are AI coding/dev tools. I notice Phoenix CLI is dated January 17, which is outside our 14-day window (Jan 30 - Feb 12, 2026), so I'll need to remove it.

Let me verify and filter the candidates systematically:
